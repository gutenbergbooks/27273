<h4><a name="patient_arg" id="patient_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>

<p><span class="firstword">Sir</span> Patient Fancy, a hypochondriacal
old alderman, has taken a second wife, Lucia, a&nbsp;young and beautiful
woman who, although feigning great affection and the strictest conjugal
fidelity, intrigues with a gallant, Charles Wittmore, the only obstacle
to their having long since married being mutual poverty. However, the
jealousy and uxoriousness of the doting husband give the lovers few
opportunities; on one occasion, indeed, as Lady Fancy is entertaining
Wittmore in the garden they are surprised by Sir Patient, and she is
obliged to pass her visitor off under the name of Fainlove as a suitor
to her step-daughter, Isabella, in which rôle he is accepted by Sir
Patient. But Isabella has betrothed herself to Lodwick, a&nbsp;son of
the pedantic Lady Knowell: whilst Lucretia Knowell loves Leander, the
alderman’s nephew, in spite of the fact that she is promised by her
mother to Sir Credulous Easy, a&nbsp;bumpkinly knight from Devonshire.
Lodwick, who is a close friend of Leander, has been previously known to
Sir Credulous, and resolving to trick and befool the coxcomb warmly
welcomes him on his arrival in town. He persuades him, in fine, to give
a ridiculous serenade, or, rather, a&nbsp;hideous hubbub, of noisy
instruments under his mistress’ window. A&nbsp;little before this Lady
Knowell with a party of friends has visited Sir Patient, who is her next
neighbour, and the loud laughter, talking, singing and foppery so enrage
the precise old valetudinarian that he resolves to leave London
immediately for his country house, a&nbsp;circumstance which would be
fatal to his wife’s amours. Wittmore and she, however, persuade him that
he is very ill, and on being shown his face in a looking-glass that
magnifies instead of in his ordinary mirror, he imagines that he is
suddenly swollen and puffed with disease, and so is led lamenting to
bed, leaving the coast clear for the nonce. Isabella, however, has made
an assignation with Lodwick at the same time that her stepmother eagerly
awaits her own gallant, and in the dark young Knowell is by mistake
escorted to Lucia’s chamber, whilst Wittmore encountering Isabella, and
thinking her Lady Fancy, proceeds to act so amorously that the error is
soon discovered and the girl flies from his ardour. In her hurry,
however, she rushes blundering into Lucia’s bedchamber, where she finds
Knowell. It is just at this moment that Sir Credulous Easy’s deafening
fanfare re-echoes in the street, and Sir Patient, awakened and
half-stunned by the pandemonium, is led grouty and bawling into his
wife’s room, where he discovers Knowell, whom Lucia has all this time
taken for Wittmore; but her obvious confusion and dismay thereon are
such that Sir Patient does not suspect the real happenings, which she
glozes over with a tale concerning Isabella. Meantime the serenaders are
dispersed and routed by a band of the alderman’s servants and clerks.
Sir Credulous courting Lucretia, who loathes him, meets Knowell bringing
a tale of a jealous rival able to poison at a distance by means of some
strangely subtle venom, upon which the Devonshire knight conceals
himself in a basket, hoping to be conveyed away to
<span class="pagenum">4</span>
his old uncle in Essex, whereas he is merely transported next door. Sir
Patient, who surprises his lady writing a love-letter, which she turns
off by appending Isabella’s name thereto, is so overwhelmed with her
seeming affection and care for his family that he presents her with
eight thousand pounds in gold and silver, and resolves to marry his
daughter to Fainlove (Wittmore) without any further delay. But whilst he
is gone down to prayers and Lucia is entertaining her lover, the old
nurse informs him that his little daughter Fanny has long been privy to
an intrigue between Knowell and Isabella, whereupon, in great
perturbation, he rushes upstairs again to consult with his wife, who
hurries Wittmore under the bed. Sir Patient, however, warmed with
cordials which he quaffs to revive his drooping spirits, does not offer
to quit the chamber, but lies down on the bed, and the gallant is only
enabled to slip out unobserved after several accidents each of which
nearly betrays his presence. Upon the marriage morning Isabella in a
private interview rejects her pseudo-suitor with scorn and contumely,
whereat Knowell, who has of intent been listening, reveals to her that
it is his friend Wittmore and no real lover who is seemingly courting
her, and with his help, whilst Sir Patient is occupied with a
consultation of doctors (amongst whom Sir Credulous appears disguised as
a learned member of the faculty), Isabella and Knowell are securely
married. Lady Knowell, who has feigned a liking for Leander, generously
gives him to Lucretia, Sir Patient’s attention being still engrossed by
the physicians who assemble in great force. Soon after, at Leander’s
instigation, in order to test his wife, Sir Patient feigns to be dead of
a sudden apoplexy, and for a few moments, whilst others are present,
Lucia laments him with many plaints and tears, but immediately changes
when she is left alone with Wittmore. The lovers’ plans, however, are
overheard by the husband, who promptly confronts his wife with her
duplicity. Amazed and confounded indeed, he forgives Leander and his
daughter for marrying contrary to his former wishes; and when Lucia
coolly announces her intention to play the hypocrite and puritan no
more, but simply to enjoy herself with the moneys he has settled on her
without let or proviso, he humorously declares he will for his part also
drop the prig and canter, and turn town gallant and spark.</p>


<h4><a name="patient_source" id="patient_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> spite of Mrs. Behn’s placid
assertion in her address ‘To the Reader’ that she has only taken ‘but a
very bare hint’ from a foreign source, <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i>, the
critics who cried out that <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i> ‘was made out of at
least four French plays’ are patently right. Sir Patient is, of course,
Argan throughout and in detail; moreover, in the scene where the old
alderman feigns death, there is very copious and obvious borrowing from
Act iii of <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i>. Some of the doctors’ lingo also
comes from the third and final interlude of Molière’s comedy, whilst the
idea of the medical consultation is pilfered from <i>L’Amour
Médecin</i>, Act ii, <span class="smallroman">II</span>. Sir Credulous
Easy is Monsieur de Porceaugnac, but his first entrance is taken
wholesale from Brome’s <i>The Damoiselle; or, The New Ordinary</i> (8vo,
1653), Act ii, <span class="smallroman">I</span>, where Amphilus and
Trebasco discourse exactly as do Curry and his master. The pedantic Lady
Knowell is a mixture of Philaminte and
<span class="pagenum">5</span>
Bélise from <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>. The circumstance in Act iv,
<span class="smallroman">II</span>, when Lucia, to deceive her
husband, appends Isabella’s name to the love-letter she has herself just
written, had already been used by Wycherley at the commencement of Act v
of that masterpiece of comedy, <i>The Country Wife</i> (4to, 1675,
produced in 1672), where Mrs. Pinchwife, by writing ‘your slighted
Alithea’ as the subscription of a letter, completely befools her
churlish spouse.</p>

<p>Molière’s comedies, which were so largely conveyed in <i>Sir Patient
Fancy</i>, have been a gold mine for many of our dramatists. From <i>Le
Malade Imaginaire</i> Miller took his <i>Mother-in-Law; or, The Doctor
the Disease</i>, produced at the Haymarket, 12 February, 1734, and Isaac
Bickerstaffe, <i>Dr. Last in his Chariot</i>, produced at the same
theatre 25 August, 1769. In this farce Bickerstaffe further introduces
the famous consultation scene from <i>L’Amour Médecin</i>, a&nbsp;play
which had been made use of by Lacy, <i>The Dumb Lady; or, The Farrier
made a Physician</i> (1672); by Owen Swiney, <i>The Quacks; or, Love’s
the Physician</i>, produced at Drury Lane, 18 March, 1705; by Miller,
<i>Art and Nature</i>, produced at the same theatre 16 February, 1738;
and in an anonymous one act piece, which is little more than a bare
translation under the title <i>Love is the Doctor</i>, performed once
only at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 4 April, 1734.</p>

<p><i>Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</i> supplied Ravenscroft with material no
less than three times. In <i>Mamamouchi; or, The Citizen turn’d
Gentleman</i>, acted early in 1672, we have Sir Simon Softhead, who is
Pourceaugnac in detail; in <i>The Careless Lovers</i>, produced at the
Duke’s House in 1673, and again in <i>The Canterbury Guests; or,
A&nbsp;Bargain Broken</i>, played at the Theatre Royal in 1694, we have
<i>in extenso</i> Act ii, Scenes <span class="smallroman">VIII</span>,
<span class="smallroman">IX</span>, <span class="smallroman">X</span>, of the French comedy. Crowne’s Sir Mannerley
Shallow (<i>The Country Wit</i>, 1675) comes from the same source.
<i>Squire Trelooby</i>, produced at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 20 March,
1704, and revived as <i>The Cornish Squire</i> at Drury Lane, 3 January,
1734, is ascribed to Vanbrugh, Congreve, and Walsh; but this, as well as
a farce produced at Dublin in 1720 by Charles Shadwell and entitled
<i>The Plotting Lovers; or, The Dismal Squire</i>, cannot claim to be
anything but translations. Miller’s <i>Mother-in-Law</i>, again,
includes much of <i>Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</i>; and Thomas Sheridan’s
<i>Captain O’Blunder; or, The Brave Irishman</i>, produced at Goodman’s
Fields, 31 January, 1746, is a poor adaptation. Mrs. Parsons abbreviated
Molière to <i>The Intrigues of a Morning</i>, played at Covent Garden,
18 April, 1792, a&nbsp;jejune effort. <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i> was
rather racily transformed by Thomas Wright into <i>The Female
Virtuosoes</i>, and produced at Drury Lane in 1693. It was revived as
<i>No Fools like Wits</i> at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 10 January, 1721, to
anticipate Cibber’s <i>The Refusal; or, The Ladies’ Philosophy</i>,
which had a run of six nights. Miller, in his <i>The Man of Taste</i>,
once more had resource to Molière. His play was produced at Drury Lane,
6 March, 1735. It has no value.</p>

<p>Of all these borrowers Mrs. Behn is infinitely the best. <i>Sir
Patient Fancy</i> is, indeed, an excellent comedy, and had she used more
leisure might have been improved to become quite first rate. Perhaps she
plagiarized so largely owing to the haste with which her play was
written and staged, but yet <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘eveything’">everything</ins> she touched has been invested with
an irresistible humour. A&nbsp;glaring example of her hurry remains in
the fact that the ‘precise clerk’
<span class="pagenum">6</span>
of Sir Patient has a double nomenclature. In Act iii he appears as Abel;
in Act iv, <span class="smallroman">III</span>, he is referred to as
Bartholomew, and under this last name has an exit marked in Act v. This
character is only on the stage twice and is given but some three or four
lines to speak. Obviously, when writing her fourth act, Aphra forgot she
had already christened him.</p>


<h4><a name="patient_hist" id="patient_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p><i>Sir Patient Fancy</i> was produced at the Duke’s Theatre, Dorset
Garden, in January, 1678, with an exceptionally strong cast which
included both Betterton and his wife. It met with the great success it
fully deserved. The critics, indeed, were not slow to detect Mrs. Behn’s
plagiarisms, but the only real opposition was negligible disapproval of
a modest clique, who a few years later vainly tried to damn <i>The Lucky
Chance</i>. After the death of the two famous comedians Antony Leigh and
James Nokes in December, 1692, <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i>, owing to the
inability of succeeding actors to sustain the two rôles, Sir Patient and
Sir Credulous, which had been created by this gifted pair, completely
dropped out of the repertory of the theatre. It was not singular in its
fate, for Cibber expressly tells us that D’Urfey’s excellent comedy
<i>The Fond Husband</i>, and Crowne’s satirical <i>City Politics</i>,
‘lived only by the extraordinary performance of Nokes and Leigh.’</p>

<p>I Printed this Play with all the impatient haste one ought to do, who

could invent to cast on Woman; and which only my being a Woman has

to no other end than to hear what they condemn in this: <i>but from a
Woman it was unnaturall</i>: but how so Cruell an unkindness came into
their imaginations I can by no means guess; unless by those whose Lovers
by long absence, or those whom Age or Ugliness have rendered a little
distant from those things they would fain imagin here&mdash;But if such
as these durst profane their Chast ears with hearing it over again, or
taking it into their serious Consideration in their Cabinets; they would
find nothing that the most innocent Virgins can have cause to blush at:
but confess with me that no Play either Ancient or Modern has less of
that Bug-bear Bawdry in it. Others <a class="comm" name="patient_commtag1" id="patient_commtag1" href="#patient_commnote1">to show their breeding (as <i>Bays</i> sayes)</a>
cryed it was made out of at least four <i>French</i> Plays, when I had
but a very bare hint from one, the <i>Malad Imagenere</i>, which was
given me translated by a Gentleman infinitely to advantage; but how much
of the <i>French</i> is in this, I&nbsp;leave to those who do indeed
understand it and have seen it at the Court. The play had no other
Misfortune but that of coming out for a Womans: had it been owned by a
Man, though the most Dull Unthinking Rascally Scribler in Town, it had
been a most admirable Play. Nor does it’s loss of Fame with the Ladies
do it much hurt, though they ought to have had good Nature and justice
enough to have attributed all its faults to the Authours unhappiness,
who is forced to write for Bread and not ashamed to owne it, and
consequently ought to write to please (if she can) an Age which has
given severall proofs it was by this way of writing to be obliged,
though it is a way too cheap for men of wit to pursue who write for
Glory, and a way which even I despise as much below me.</p>

<div class="song">
<p><span class="firstword">We</span> write not now, as th’ antient

<p>True Comedy, writ even in <em>Dryden’s</em> Style,</p>
<p>Will hardly raise your Humours to a Smile.</p>
<p>Long did his Sovereign Muse the Scepter sway,</p>
<p>And long with Joy you did true Homage pay:</p>
<p>But now, like happy States, luxurious grown,</p>
<p>The Monarch Wit unjustly you dethrone,</p>
<p>And a <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘Tryannick’">Tyrannick</ins> Commonwealth prefer,</p>
<p>Where each small Wit starts up and claims his share;</p>
<p>And all those Laurels are in pieces torn,</p>
<p>Which did e’er while one sacred Head adorn.</p>
<p>Nay, even the Women now pretend to reign;</p>
<p>Defend us from a Poet <em>Joan</em> again!</p>
<p>That Congregation’s in a hopeful way</p>
<p>To Heaven, where the Lay-Sisters teach and pray.</p>
<p>Oh the great Blessing of a little Wit!</p>
<p>I’ve seen an elevated Poet sit,</p>
<p>And hear the Audience laugh and clap, yet say,</p>
<p>Gad after all, ’tis a damn’d silly Play:</p>
<p>He unconcern’d, cries only&mdash;Is it so?</p>
<p>No matter, these unwitty things will do,</p>

<p>That might so cheaply please the Appetite?</p>
<p>Such homely Fare you’re like to find to night:</p>
<p>Our Author</p>
<p>Knows better how to juggle than to write:</p>
<p>Alas! a Poet’s good for nothing now,</p>
<p>Unless he have the knack of conjuring too;</p>

<p>How their strange Miracles are brought to pass.</p>

<p>With all the Hocus Art of Legerdemain;</p>
<p>Your dancing Tester, Nut-meg, and your Cups,</p>

<span class="smallcaps">Scene I.</span></a>
A Room <a class="notes" name="patient_texttag3" id="patient_texttag3" href="#patient_textnote3">in Lady
<em>Knowell’s</em> House</a>.</h4>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Lucretia</em> with <em>Isabella</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
’Tis much I owe to Fortune, my dear <i>Lucretia</i>, for being so kind
to make us Neighbours, where with Ease we may continually exchange our
Souls and Thoughts without the attendance of a Coach, and those other
little Formalities that make a Business of a Visit; it looks so like a
Journey, I&nbsp;hate it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Attendance is that Curse to Greatness that confines the Soul, and spoils
good Humour; we are free whilst thus alone, and can laugh at the
abominable Fopperies of this Town.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
And lament the numberless Impertinences wherewith they continually
plague all young Women of Quality.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Yet these are the precious things our grave Parents still chuse out to
make us happy with, and all for a filthy Jointure, the undeniable
argument for our Slavery to Fools.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Custom is unkind to our Sex, not to allow us free Choice; but we above
all Creatures must be forced to endure the formal Recommendations of a
Parent, and the more insupportable Addresses of an odious Fop; whilst
the Obedient Daughter stands&mdash;thus&mdash;with her Hands pinn’d
before her, a&nbsp;set Look, few Words, and a Mein that cries&mdash;Come
marry me: out upon’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
I perceive then, whatever your Father designs, you are resolv’d to love
your own way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Thou mayst lay thy Maidenhead upon’t, and be sure of the Misfortune to
win.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
My Brother <i>Lodwick’s</i> like to be a happy Man then.</p>

<span class="pagenum">12</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Faith, my dear <i>Lodwick</i> or no body in my heart, and I hope thou
art as well resolv’d for my Cousin <i>Leander</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Here’s my Hand upon’t, I am; yet there’s something sticks upon my
stomach, which you must know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Spare the Relation, for I have observ’d of late your Mother to have
order’d her Eyes with some softness, her Mouth endeavouring to sweeten
it self into Smiles and Dimples, as if she meant to recal Fifteen again,
and gave it all to <i>Leander</i>, for at him she throws her Darts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Is’t possible thou should’st have perceived it already?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Long since.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
And now I begin to love him, ’twould vex me to see my Mother marry
him&mdash;well, I&nbsp;shall never call him Father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
He’ll take care to give himself a better Title.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
This <i>Devonshire</i> Knight too, who is recommended to my Mother as a
fit Husband for me, I&nbsp;shall be so tormented with&mdash;My Brother
swears he’s the pertest, most unsufferable Fool he ever saw; when he was
at my Uncle’s last Summer, he made all his Diversion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Prithee let him make ours now, for of all Fops your Country Fop is the
most tolerable Animal; those of the Town are the most unmanagable Beasts
in Nature.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
And are the most noisy, keeping Fops.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Keeping begins to be as ridiculous as Matrimony, and is a greater
Imposition upon the Liberty of Man; the Insolence and Expence of their
Mistresses has almost tir’d out all but the Old and Doting part of
Mankind: The rest begin to know their value, and set a price upon a good
Shape, a&nbsp;tolerable Face and Mein:&mdash;and some there are who have
made excellent Bargains for themselves that way, and will flatter ye and
jilt ye an Antiquated Lady as artfully as the most experienc’d Miss of
’em all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Lord, Lord! what will this World come to?&mdash;but this Mother of
mine&mdash;<i>Isabella.</i>
<span class="stagedir">Sighs.</span></p>

<span class="pagenum">13</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Is discreet and virtuous enough, a&nbsp;little too affected, as being
the most learned of her Sex.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Methinks to be read in the Arts, as they call ’em, is the peculiar
Province of the other Sex.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Indeed the Men would have us think so, and boast their Learning and
Languages; but if they can find any of our Sex fuller of Words, and to
so little purpose as some of their Gownmen, I’ll be content to change my
Petticoats for Pantaloons, and go to a Grammar-school.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Oh, they’re the greatest Babelards in Nature.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
They call us easy and fond, and charge us with all weakness; but look
into their Actions of Love, State or War, their roughest business, and
you shall find ’em sway’d by some who have the luck to find their
<a class="notes" name="patient_texttag4" id="patient_texttag4" href="#patient_textnote4">Foibles</a>; witness my Father, a&nbsp;Man
reasonable enough, till drawn away by doting Love and Religion: what a
Monster my young Mother makes of him! flatter’d him first into
Matrimony, and now into what sort of Fool or Beast she pleases to make
him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
I wonder she does not turn him to Christianity; methinks a Conventicle
should ill agree with her Humour.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Oh, she finds it the only way to secure her from his Suspicion, which if
she do not e’er long give him cause for, I&nbsp;am mistaken in her
Humour.&mdash;</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter L. <em>Knowell</em> and <em>Leander</em>.</p>

<p>But see your Mother and my Cousin <i>Leander</i>, who seems, poor
man, under some great Consternation, for he looks as gravely as a
Lay-Elder conducting his Spouse from a Sermon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
Oh, fy upon’t. See, Mr. <i>Fancy</i>, where your Cousin and my
<i>Lucretia</i> are idling: <i>Dii boni</i>, what an insupportable loss
of time’s this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Which might be better imploy’d, if I might instruct ’em, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
Ay, Mr. <i>Fancy</i>, in Consultation with the
<span class="pagenum">14</span>
Antients.&mdash;Oh the delight of Books! when I was of their age,
I&nbsp;always imploy’d my looser Hours in reading&mdash;if serious,
’twas <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Seneca</i>, <i>Plutarch’s Morals</i>, or some
such useful Author; if in an Humour gay, I&nbsp;was for Poetry,
<i>Virgil</i>, <i>Homer</i> or <i>Tasso</i>. Oh that Love between
<i>Renaldo</i> and <a class="comm" name="patient_commtag2" id="patient_commtag2" href="#patient_commnote2"><i>Armida</i></a>, Mr.
<i>Fancy</i>! Ah the Caresses that fair <i>Corcereis</i> gave, and
received from the young Warrior, ah how soft, delicate and tender! Upon
my Honour I cannot read them in the Excellence of their Original
Language, without I know not what Emotions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Methinks ’tis very well in our Mother Tongue, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
O, Faugh, Mr. <i>Fancy</i>, what have you said, Mother Tongue! Can any
thing that’s great or moving be express’d in filthy
<i>English</i>?&mdash;I’ll give you an Energetical proof, Mr.
<i>Fancy</i>; observe but divine <i>Homer</i> in the <i>Grecian</i>
Language&mdash;<a class="notes" name="patient_texttag5" id="patient_texttag5" href="#patient_textnote5"><i>Ton d’ apamibominous
prosiphe podas ochus Achilleus!</i></a> Ah how it sounds! which
English’t dwindles into the most grating stuff:&mdash;Then the
swift-foot <i>Achilles</i> made reply: oh, faugh.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
So now my Mother’s in her right Sphere.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
Come, Mr. <i>Fancy</i>, we’ll pursue our first design of retiring into
my Cabinet, and reading a leaf or two in <i>Martial</i>; I&nbsp;am a
little dull, and wou’d fain laugh.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Methinks, Madam, Discourse were much better with these young Ladies.
Dear Lucretia, find some way to release me.
<span class="stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
Oh, how I hate the impertinence of Women, who for the generality have no
other knowledge than that of dressing; I&nbsp;am uneasy with the
unthinking Creatures.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Indeed ’tis much better to be entertaining a young Lover alone; but I’ll
prevent her, if possible.
<span class="stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
No, I am for the substantial pleasure of an Author.
<i>Philosophemur!</i> is my Motto,&mdash;I’m strangely fond of you, Mr.
<i>Fancy</i>, for being a Scholar.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Who, Madam, I a Scholar? the greatest Dunce
<span class="pagenum">15</span>
in Nature&mdash;Malicious Creatures, will you leave me to her mercy?
<span class="stagedir">
To them aside.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Prithee assist him in his misery, for I am <a class="notes" name="patient_texttag6" id="patient_texttag6" href="#patient_textnote6">Mudd</a>, and can do nothing towards it.
<span class="stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Who, my Cousin <i>Leander</i> a Scholar, Madam?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
Sure he’s too much a Gentleman to be a Scholar.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
I vow, Madam, he spells worse than a Country Farrier when he prescribes
a Drench.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Then, Madam, I write the leudest hand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Worse than a Politician or a States-man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
He cannot read it himself when he has done.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Not a word on’t, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">L. Kno.</span>
This agreement to abuse him, I&nbsp;understand&mdash;
<span class="stagedir continue">Aside.</span></p>
<p class="continue">
&mdash;Well, then, Mr. <i>Fancy</i>, let’s to my Cabinet&mdash;your
hand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lean.</span>
Now shall I be teas’d unmercifully,&mdash;I’ll wait on you, Madam.

Hah, my dear Isabella here, and without a Spy! what a blessed
opportunity must I be forc’d to lose, for there is just now arriv’d my
Sister’s Lover, whom I am oblig’d to receive: but if you have a mind to
laugh a little&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Laugh! why, are you turn’d Buffoon, Tumbler, or Presbyterian
Preacher?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
No, but there’s a Creature below more ridiculous than either of
these.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
For love’s sake, what sort of Beast is that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Sir <i>Credulous Easy</i>, your new Lover just come to town Bag and
Baggage, and I was going to acquaint my Mother with it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
You’ll find her well employ’d with my Cousin <i>Leander</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lucr.</span>
A happy opportunity to free him: but what shall I do now, Brother?</p>

<span class="pagenum">16</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Oh, let me alone to ruin him with my Mother: get you gone, I&nbsp;think

Not so joyful neither, Sir, when you shall know poor <i>Gillian’s</i>

Zoz, I’d ne’er lose precious time about her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Right, Sir; and to say truth, these Women have so much Contradiction in

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Why, faith, she has many odd Humors hard enough to hit.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Zoz, let ’em be as hard as <i>Hercules</i> his Labors in the Vale of

Sir <i>Patient</i> cannot now be spoken with. But, Sir, that which I was

All this, Sir, we suspected, and smok’d your borrowing Money last night;
and what I said was to gain the mighty secret that had been so long kept
from your Friends:&mdash;but thou hast done a baseness&mdash;

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
Did you not rob me of the Victory then I’ve been so long a toiling
for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
If I had, ’twould not have made her guilty, nor me a Criminal; she
taking me for one she lov’d, and I her for one that had no Interest in
my Friend: and who the Devil wou’d have refus’d so fine a Woman? Nor had
I but that I was prevented by her Husband.&mdash;But <i>Isabella</i>,
Sir, you must resign.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
I will, provided that our Friendship’s safe; I&nbsp;am this day to marry
her, and if you can find a means to do’t in my room, I&nbsp;shall resign
my Interest to my Friend; for ’tis the lovely Mother I adore.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
And was it you I fought with in the Garden?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
Yes, and thereby hangs a tale of a mistake almost equal to thine, which
I’ll at leisure tell you.

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
I’m glad they’re Friends; Zoz, here was like to have been a pretty

Fools that are Lovers?</p>

Look ye, I am a damn’d dull Fellow at Invention, I’ll therefore leave
you to contrive matters by your selves, whilst I’ll go try how kind
Fortune will be to me this Morning, and see in what readiness my Bride
is. What you do must be thought on suddenly; I’ll wait on you anon, and
let you know how matters go.&mdash;I’m as impatient to know the truth of
this, as for an opportunity to enjoy <i>Lucia.</i>

What was this long Whisper, something about me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Why, yes, faith, I was persuading him to speak to his Friend about this
Business; but he swears there’s no hopes of a Reconciliation: you are a
dead Man, unless some cleanly conveyance of you be soon thought on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Why, I’ll keep within doors, and defy Malice and foul Weather.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Oh, he means to get a Warrant, and search for stolen Goods, prohibited
Commodities or Conventicles; there’s a thousand Civil Pretences in this

They both pause a while.</span></p>

What is’t?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Ha, ha, ha, I must have leave to laugh to think how neatly I shall
defeat this Son of a Whore of a thunder thumping Hector.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Be serious, Sir, this is no laughing matter; if I might advise, you
should steal into the Country, for two or three days, till the Business
be blown over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Lord, thou art so hasty and conceited of thy own Invention, thou wilt
not give a Man leave to think in thy company: why, these were my very

watch me as narrowly as an enraged Serjeant upon an Escape.</p>

Mr. <i>Knowell</i> was not uncivil to your Ladyship. I&nbsp;had no time
to ask what pass’d between you.</p>

Yes, my Dear, going this morning into her Chamber, she not being there,
I&nbsp;took up a Letter that lay open on her Table, and out of curiosity
read it; as near as I can remember ’twas to this purpose: I&nbsp;writ it
out now, because I had a mind thou shou’dst see’t; for I can hide

Lovers! Tell me not of Lovers, my Lady <i>Fancy</i>; with Reverence to

discretion, in which you do abound most plentifully. But pray let not

her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
How came you by this Letter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bet.</span>
Miss <i>Fanny</i> receiv’d it by a String from his Window, by which he
took up that you writ to him this Morning.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
What means this nicety? forbear I say.&mdash;

You cannot be too fine upon your Wedding-day.</p>

Thou art mistaken, leave me,&mdash;whatever he says here to satisfy my
Jealousy, I&nbsp;am confirm’d that he was false: yet this assurance to
free me from this intended Marriage, makes me resolve to pardon him,
however guilty.&mdash;</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Wittmore</em>.</p>

<p>How now! what means this Insolence? How dare you, having so lately
made your guilty approaches, venture again into my presence?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
Why? Is there any danger, but what’s so visible in those fair Eyes?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
And there may lie enough, Sir, when they’re angry. By what Authority do
you make this saucy Visit?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
That of a Husband, Madam; I <a class="notes" name="patient_texttag46" id="patient_texttag46" href="#patient_textnote46">come</a> to congratulate the mighty Joy this Day

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Thou darst not marry me, there will be danger in’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
Why, sure you do not carry Death in your Embraces, I&nbsp;find no Terror
in that lovely Shape, no Daggers in that pretty scornful Look; that
Breath that utters so
<span class="pagenum">90</span>
much Anger now, last night was sweet as new-blown Roses are,&mdash;and
spoke such Words, so tender and so kind.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
And canst thou think they were address’d to thee?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
No, nor cou’d the Shade of Night hide the Confusion which disorder’d
you, at the discovery that I was not he, the blessed he you look’d
for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Leave me, thou hated Object of my Soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
This will not serve your turn, for I must marry you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Then thou art a Fool, and drawest thy Ruin on; why, I&nbsp;will hate
thee,&mdash;hate thee most extremely.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
That will not anger me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Why, I will never let thee touch me, nor kiss my Hand, nor come into my

Are there no other Women kind, fair, and to be purchas’d? he cannot
starve for Beauty in this Age, that has a stock to buy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
So wou’d you, had you lov’d me, in a year or two; therefore like a kind
civil Husband, I’ve made provision for you, a&nbsp;Friend, and one I
dare trust my Honour with,&mdash;’tis Mr. <i>Knowell</i>, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
<i>Lodwick!</i> What Devil brought that Name to his
knowledge?&mdash;Canst thou know him, and yet dare hope to marry me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
We have agreed it, and on these conditions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Thou basely injurest him, he cannot do a Deed he ought to blush for:
<i>Lodwick</i> do this! Oh, do not credit it,&mdash;prithee be just and
kind for thy own Honour’s sake; be quickly so, the hasty minutes fly,
and will anon make up the fatal Hour that will undo me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Wit.</span>
’Tis true, within an hour you must submit to <i>Hymen</i>, there’s no
avoiding it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
Nay, then be gone, my poor submissive Prayers, and all that dull
Obedience Custom has made us Slaves to.&mdash;Do sacrifice me, lead me

all the holy mystick Words can conjure from me the consenting Syllable:
No, I&nbsp;will not add one word to make the Charm complete, but stand
as silent in the inchanting Circle, as if the Priests were raising

E’en honest <i>Charles Wittmore</i> here, thy Friend and mine, no

<p><span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
<i>Wittmore!</i> that Friend I’ve often heard thee name? Now some kind
mischief on him, he has so frighted me, I&nbsp;scarce can bring my Sense
to so much order, to thank him that he loves me not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Thou shalt defer that payment to more leisure; we’re Men of business
now. My Mother, knowing of a Consultation of Physicians which your
Father has this day appointed to meet at his House, has bribed Monsieur

Doctor or two of her recommending, who shall amuse him with discourse
till we get ourselves married; and to make it the more ridiculous,
I&nbsp;will release Sir <i>Credulous</i> from the Basket, I&nbsp;saw it

like an old Lady’s Wedding Gown of my acquaintance.&mdash;But what’s the
danger past, Man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
No, but there’s a necessity of your being for some time disguis’d to act
a Physician.</p>

<span class="pagenum">92</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
How! a Physician! that I can easily do, for I understand Simples.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
That’s not material, so you can but banter well, be very grave, and put
on a starch’d Countenance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Banter! what’s that, Man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lod.</span>
Why, Sir, talking very much, and meaning just nothing; be full of Words
without any connection, sense or conclusion. Come in with me, and I’ll
instruct you farther.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Pshaw, is that all? say no more on’t, I’ll do’t, let me alone for
Bantering&mdash;But this same damn’d Rival&mdash;</p>

Sure <i>Lucretia</i> merits a Husband of as much worth as your Nephew,

A better, Madam, for he’s the leudest Hector in the Town; he has all the

Nothing, Madam, since I’m convinc’d of your Goodness.</p>

You flatter, Sir, this is mere Adulation.</p>

No, I am that wild Extravagant my Uncle render’d me, and cannot live

To one Woman you mean? I shall not stand with you for a Mistress or two;
I&nbsp;hate a dull morose unfashionable Blockhead to my Husband; nor
shall I be the first example of a suffering Wife, Sir. Women were
created poor obedient things.</p>

Oh, you’re too reasonable.</p>

<div class="intro">

<span class="pagenum">119</span>
<h4><a name="prince_arg" id="prince_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>

<p><span class="firstword">Frederick</span>, ‘the Amorous Prince,’ a
mercurial young gallant, son to the Duke of Florence, under a solemn
promise of marriage debauches Cloris, sister to his friend and
confidant, Curtius. The girl has always led a secluded country life, and
this relationship is unknown to the Prince, who upon hearing the praises
of Laura, beloved by Curtius, straightway resolves to win this lady
also. Laura’s brother Lorenzo, a&nbsp;wanton madcap favourite of
Frederick’s, gladly effects the required introduction, and when Curtius
interrupts and forbids, Salvator, father to Laura and Lorenzo, promptly
turns the quondam lover out of the house. Lorenzo himself is idly
pursuing Clarina, wife to a certain Antonio, an abortive intrigue
carried on to his own impoverishment, but the enrichment of Isabella,
Clarina’s woman, a&nbsp;wench who fleeces him unmercifully. Antonio
being of a quaint and jealous humour would have his friend Alberto make
fervent love to Clarina, in order that by her refusals and chill denials
her spotless conjugal fidelity may be proved. However, Ismena, Clarina’s
sister, appears in a change of clothes as the wife, and manifold
complications ensue, but eventually all is cleared and Ismena accepts
Alberto, whom she has long loved; not before Isabella, having by a trick
compelled Lorenzo to declare himself her husband, enforces the bargain.
Cloris, meanwhile, disguised as a boy under the name of Philibert,
attaches herself to Frederick, first succouring him when he is wounded
in a duel by Curtius. Curtius to avenge his wrongs disguises himself,
and as a pandar entices Frederick into a snare by promises of supplying
the amorous Prince with lovely cyprians. Bravos, however, are in
waiting, but these prove to be in the service of Antonio, who appears
with Alberto and their friends, completely frustrating the plot, whilst
Clarina, Ismena, and other ladies have acted the courtezans to deceive
Curtius, and at the same time read the Prince a salutary lesson. He
profits so much by this experience that he takes Cloris, whose sex is
discovered, to be his bride, whilst Laura bestows her hand on the
repentant and forgiven Curtius.</p>


<h4><a name="prince_source" id="prince_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>

<p><span class="firstword">Mrs. Behn</span> has taken her episode of
Antonio’s persuading Alberto to woo Clarina from Robert Davenport’s fine
play, <i>The City Night-Cap</i> (4to 1661, but licensed 24 October,
1624) where Lorenzo induces Philippo to test Abstemia in the same way.
Astrea, however, has considerably altered the conduct of the intrigue.
Bullen (<i>The Works of Robert Davenport</i>, 1890) conclusively and
exhaustively demonstrates that Davenport made use of Greene’s popular
<i>Philomela; the Lady Fitzwater’s Nightingale</i> (1592, 1615, and
1631), wherein Count Philippo employs Giovanni Lutesio to ‘make
experience of his wife’s [Philomela’s] honesty’, rather than was under
<span class="pagenum">120</span>
any obligation to Cervantes’ <i>Curioso Impertinente, Don Quixote</i>,
Book IV, ch. vi-viii. Read, Dunlop, and Hazlitt all had express’d the
same opinion. The Spanish tale turns upon the fact of Anselmo, the
Curious Impertinent, enforcing his friend Lothario to tempt his wife
Camilla. Such a theme, however, is common, and with variations is to be
found in Italian novelle. Recent authorities are inclined to suggest
that the plot of Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>The Coxcomb</i> (1610), much
of which runs on similar lines, is not founded on Cervantes. Southerne,
in his comedy, <i>The Disappointment; or, The Mother in Fashion</i>
(1684) and ‘starch Johnny Crowne’ in <i>The Married Beau</i> (1694),
both comedies of no little wit and merit, are patently indebted to
<i>The Curious Impertinent</i>. Cervantes had also been used three
quarters of a century before by Nat Field in his <i>Amends for
Ladies</i> (4to, 1618), where Sir John Loveall tries his wife in an
exactly similar manner to Lorenzo, Count Philippo and Anselmo.</p>

<p>The amours of the Florentine court are Mrs. Behn’s own invention; but
the device by which Curtius ensnares Frederick is not unlike Vendice and
Hippolito’s trapping of the lecherous old Duke in <i>The Revenger’s
Tragedy</i> (4to, 1607), albeit the saturnine Tourneur gives the whole
scene a far more terrible and tragic catastrophe.</p>

<p>In January, 1537, Lorenzino de Medici having enticed Duke Alessandro
of Florence to his house under pretext of an assignation with a certain
Caterina Ginori, after a terrible struggle assassinated him with the aid
of a notorious bravo. Several plays have been founded upon this history.
Notable amongst them are Shirley’s admirable tragedy, <i>The Traitor</i>
(licensed May, 1631, 4to 1635) and in later days de Musset’s
<i>Lorenzaccio</i> (1834).</p>

<p>The Mask in Act v of <i>The Amorous Prince</i> is in its purport most
palpably akin to the Elizabethans.</p>


<h4><a name="prince_hist" id="prince_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p><i>The Amorous Prince</i> was produced by the Duke’s Company in the
spring of 1671 at their Lincoln’s Inn Fields theatre, whence they
migrated in November of the same year to the magnificent new house in
Dorset Garden. No performers’ names are given to the comedy, which met
with a very good reception. It seems to have kept the boards awhile, but
there is no record of any particular revival.</p>

<p>That many Maids should wait upon your call,</p>

With much ado, I am got loose from those fair</p>
<span class="pagenum">128</span>
<p>Fetters, but not from those of her Beauty;</p>
<p>By these she still inflames me,</p>
<p>In spite of all my humours of Inconstancy;</p>
<p>So soft and young, so fair and innocent,</p>
<p>So full of Air, and yet of Languishment;</p>
<p>So much of Nature in her Heart and Eyes,</p>
<p>So timorous and so kind without disguise:</p>
<p>Such untaught Sweets in every part do move,</p>
<p>As ’gainst my Reason does compel my Love;</p>
<p>Such artless smiles, look so unorder’d too,</p>
<p>Gains more than all the charms of Courts can do;</p>
<p>From Head to Foot, a spotless Statue seems,</p>
<p>As Art, not Nature, had compos’d her Limbs;</p>
<p>So white, and so unblemish’d, oh <i>Curtius</i>!</p>
<p>I’m ravisht beyond Sense when I but think on’t;</p>
<p>How much more must my Surprize be,</p>
<p>When I behold these Wonders.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Faith, time and importunity refuse no body.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
Is that the way? had you no other Aids?</p>
<p>Made you no promise to her, Sir, of Marriage?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Oh, yes, in abundance, that’s your only bait,</p>
<p>And though they cannot hope we will perform it,</p>
<p>Yet it secures their Honour and my Pleasure.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
Then, Sir, you have enjoy’d her?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Oh, yes, and gather’d Sweets</p>
<p>Would make an Anchoret neglect his Vow,</p>
<span class="pagenum">129</span>
<p>And think he had mistook his way to future bliss,</p>
<p>Which only can be found in such Embraces;</p>
<p>’Twas hard to gain, but, <i>Curtius</i>, when once Victor,</p>
<p>Oh, how the joys of Conquest did enslave me!</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
But, Sir, methinks ’tis much that she should yield,</p>
<p>With only a bare promise that you’d marry her.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Yes, there was something more&mdash;but&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
But, what, Sir, you are not married.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Faith, yes, I’ve made a Vow,</p>
<p>And that you know would go as far with any other Man.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
But she it seems forgot you were the Prince?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
No, she urg’d that too,</p>
<p>And left no Arguments unus’d</p>
<p>Might make me sensible of what I did;</p>
<p>But I was fixt, and overcame them all,</p>
<p>Repeating still my Vows and Passions for her,</p>
<p>Till in the presence of her Maid and Heaven</p>
<p>We solemnly contracted.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
But, Sir, by your permission, was it well?</p>

<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
What wouldst thou have him do</p>
<p>That’s all on fire, and dies for an Enjoyment?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
But having gain’d it, do you love her still?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Yes, yes, extremely,</p>
<p>And would be constant to the Vows I’ve made,</p>
<p>Were I a Man, as thou art of thy self;</p>
<p>But with the aid of Counsels I must chuse,</p>
<p>And what my Soul adores I must refuse.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
This Passion, Sir, Possession will destroy,</p>
<p>And you’l love less, the more you do enjoy.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
That’s all my hope of cure; I’ll ply that game,</p>
<p>And slacken by degrees th’ unworthy flame.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Cur.</span>
Methinks, my Lord, it had more generous been</p>
<p>To’ve check’d that flame when first it did begin,</p>
<p>E’er you the slighted Victory had won,</p>
<p>And a poor harmless Virgin quite undone:</p>
<p>And what is worse, you’ve made her love you too.</p>

<span class="pagenum">130</span>
<p class="speaker">

Faith, that’s the greater mischief of the two;</p>
<p>I know to such nice virtuous Souls as thine,</p>

<span class="speaker">Isab.</span>
But why this resemblance?</p>
<p>For, Madam, since he never saw you,</p>

<p>Might you not still pass so, without this likeness?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Clar.</span>
Didst thou not say <i>Antonio</i> left the Court</p>
<p>And City, on purpose to give <i>Alberto</i> the more freedom</p>
<p>To Court me?&mdash;Whilst he was away, I needed but retire,</p>
<p>And <i>Ismena</i> appear, and ’twould suffice;</p>
<p>But now he is return’d,</p>
<p>He may chance to see them together, <i>en passant</i>, or so,</p>
<p>And this dress will abuse him as well as <i>Alberto</i>;</p>

The Plot is very likely to thrive I see,</p>

Fie, <i>Isabella</i>, what an ill opinion you have of me?</p>

Had you been bred any where</p>

<p>And have you not attempted her?</p>

<p>Thy Words and Actions did not well agree?</p>
<p>Canst thou dissemble well? didst cry and melt,</p>
<p>As if the pain you but express’d, you felt?</p>
<p>Didst kneel, and swear, and urge thy Quality,</p>
<p>Heightning it too with some Disgrace on me?</p>
<p>And didst thou too assail her feeble side?</p>
<p>For the best bait to Woman is her Pride;</p>
<p>Which some mis-call her Guard:</p>
<p>Didst thou present her with the set of Jewels?</p>
<p>For Women naturally are more inclin’d</p>
<p>To Avarice, than Men: pray tell me, Friend.</p>
<p>&mdash;Vile Woman! did she take them&mdash;</p>

I were the happiest Man on Earth, were this but true;</p>
<p>But what are single Courtships?&mdash;give her these,</p>
<p>Which will assist thy Tongue to win her Heart;</p>
<p>And that once got, the other soon will follow;</p>
<p>There’s far more Women won by Gold than Industry:</p>
<p>Try that, my dear <i>Alberto</i>,</p>
<p>And save thy Eyes the trouble of dissembling.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Content thee here, and do not tempt thy Fate,</p>

<p>What is’t could make thee happy, or restore</p>
<span class="pagenum">139</span>

<span class="speaker">Ant.</span>
This will not do;</p>
<p>No, as thou art my Friend, and lov’st my Honour,</p>
<p>Pursue <i>Clarina</i> further;</p>
<p>Rally afresh, and charge her with this Present,</p>
<p>Disturb her every night with Serenades;</p>
<p>Make Love-Songs to her, and then sing them too;</p>

<p>I’ll try a Friend more willing, though less faithful;</p>
<p>With thee my Wife and Honour too are safe,</p>

<p>’Twere yet some ease,</p>
<p>That none but thou wert witness to’t.</p>

<p class="speaker">

Spoke like my noble Friend;</p>

The Girl is well, and if she were not my Sister,</p>

<p>She has excellent good Hair, fine Teeth,</p>
<p>And good Hands, and the best natur’d Fool&mdash;</p>

Madam, this Visit was not meant to him,</p>
<p>But by a Cause more pressing I am brought,</p>
<p>Such as my Passion, not My Friendship taught;</p>
<p>A Passion which my Sighs have only shewn,</p>
<p>And now beg leave my bashful Tongue may own.</p>
<p>The knowledge, Madam, will not much surprise,</p>
<p>Which you have gain’d already from mine Eyes;</p>
<p>My timorous Heart that way my Tongue would spare,</p>
<p>And tells you of the Flames you’ve kindled there:</p>
<p>’Tis long I’ve suffered under this Constraint,</p>
<p>Have always suffer’d, but ne’er made Complaint;</p>
<p>And now against my will I must reveal</p>
<p>What Love and my Respect would fain conceal.</p>

<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
What mean you, Sir? what have you seen in me,</p>

A world of Beauties, and a world of Charms,</p>
<p>And every Smile and Frown begets new harms;</p>
<p>In vain I strove my Passion to subdue,</p>

<p>Nor will my Heart permit me to retire,</p>
<p>But makes my Eyes the convoys to my Fire,</p>
<p>And not one Glance you send is cast away.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Enough, my Lord, have you nought else to say?</p>
<p>The Plot’s betray’d, and can no further go;
<span class="stagedir">
Smiles.</span></p>
<p>The Stratagem’s discover’d to the Foe;</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
What you have said, I do confess is true,</p>
<p><i>Antonio</i> beg’d I would make love to you;</p>
<span class="pagenum">149</span>
<p>But, Madam, whilst my heart was unconfin’d,</p>
<p>A thousand ways the Treachery I declin’d&mdash;</p>
<p>But now, <i>Clarina</i>, by my Life I swear,</p>
<p>It is my own concern that brings me here:</p>
<p>Had he been just to you, I had suppress’d</p>
<p>The Flames your Eyes have kindled in my Breast;</p>
<p>But his Suspicion rais’d my Passion more,</p>
<p>And his Injustice taught me to adore:</p>

<p>Since its effects shall never injure you.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
You have oblig’d me, Sir, by your Confession,</p>
<p>And I shall own it too at such a rate,</p>
<p>As both becomes my Duty to <i>Antonio</i>,</p>
<p>And my Respect to you; but I must beg</p>
<p>You’ll never name your Passion to me more,</p>

Madam, the Prince, conducted by my Brother,</p>
<p>About an Hour since made me a Visit;</p>
<p>The Man of all the World I would have shun’d,</p>
<p>Knowing his amorous and inconstant Temper.</p>
<p>&mdash;At his approach he blusht and started back,</p>
<p>And I with great amazement did the like.</p>
<p>With fear I lost all power of going from him.</p>
<p>As he had done of making his Address;</p>
<p>He gaz’d and wonder’d, and I gaz’d on him,</p>
<p>And from his silence I became amaz’d.</p>
<p>&mdash;My Brother stood confounded at our Postures,</p>

<p>But he reply’d that <i>Curtius</i> was a Subject.</p>
<p>But sure at last I’d won upon his Goodness,</p>
<p>Had not my Father enter’d,</p>
<p>To whom the Prince addrest himself;</p>
<p>And with his moving tale so won upon him,</p>
<p>Or rather by his Quality,</p>

’Tis much methinks, a Boy of so dejected,</p>

I know not that; but if I have a thought</p>

Yes, my Lord, though I am young,</p>
<p>I’ve felt the power of Beauty;</p>
<p>And should you look upon the Object, Sir,</p>
<p>Your Wonders soon would cease;</p>
<p>Each Look does even animate Insensibles,</p>
<p>And strikes a reverend Awe upon the Soul:</p>
<p>Nothing is found so lovely.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Thou speak’st prettily, I think Love</p>
<p>Indeed has inspir’d thee.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Clo.</span>
These were the Flatteries, Sir, she us’d to me;</p>
<p>Of her it was I learn’d to speak, and sigh,</p>
<p>And look, as oft you say, I do on you.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
Why then, it seems she made returns?</p>

Ah! Sir, ’twas I that first was blest,</p>

<p>For, ’twas a Person, Sir, so much above me,&mdash;</p>
<p>It had been Sin to’ve rais’d my Eyes to her;</p>

<p>But Oh! when with a thousand <a class="notes" name="prince_texttag44" id="prince_texttag44" href="#prince_textnote44">soft</a> Expressions,</p>
<p>She did encourage me to speak of Love!</p>
<p>&mdash;My God! how soon extravagant I grew,</p>
<p>And told so oft the story of my Passion,</p>
<p>That she grew weary of the repeated Tale,</p>
<p>And punish’d my presumption with a strange neglect.

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Fred.</span>
That was pity; without a Fault?</p>

Alas, Sir, I was guilty of no Crime,</p>

<p>For all I had I sacrific’d to her;</p>
<p>&mdash;Poor worthless Treasures to any but a Lover;</p>
<p>And such you know accept the meanest things,</p>
<p>Which Love and a true Devotion do present.</p>
<p>When she was present, I found a thousand ways</p>
<p>To let her know how much I was her Slave;</p>
<span class="pagenum">185</span>
<p>And absent, still invented new ones,</p>
<p>And quite neglected all my little Business;</p>
<p>Counting the tedious Moments of the Day</p>
<p>By Sighs and Tears; thought it an Age to night,</p>
<p>Whose Darkness might secure our happy meeting:</p>
<p>But we shall meet no more on these kind Terms.
<span class="stagedir">

Come, do not weep, sweet Youth, thou art too young,</p>

<p>Thou wilt out-grow this childish Inclination,</p>
<p>And shalt see Beauties here, whose every glance</p>
<p>Kindle new Fires, and quite expel the old.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Clo.</span>
Oh, never, Sir.</p>

<p class="speaker">

When I was first in love, I thought so too,</p>

And quite forget the old?</p>

Not so; but when I see them o’er again,</p>

Oh God forbid, I should be so inconstant!</p>
<p>No, Sir, though she be false, she has my Heart,</p>
<p>And I can die, but not redeem the Victim.</p>

<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Nothing but what has rais’d it.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
To raise your Esteem, then it seems, is</p>
<p>To lessen your Love; or, as most Gallants are,</p>
<p>You’re but pleas’d with what you have not;</p>
<p>And love a Mistress with great Passion, till you find</p>
<p>Your self belov’d again, and then you hate her.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
You wrong my Soul extremely,</p>
<p>’Tis not of that ungrateful nature;</p>
<p>To love me is to me a greater Charm</p>
<p>Than that of Wit or Beauty.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
I’m glad on’t, Sir; then I have pleasant News for you,</p>
<p>I know a Lady, and a Virgin too,</p>
<p>That loves you with such Passion,</p>
<p>As has oblig’d me to become her Advocate.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
I am very much oblig’d to her,</p>
<p>If there be any such.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Upon my Life, there is; I am in earnest,</p>
<p>The Lady is my Sister too.</p>

<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
How, <i>Clarina</i>, this from you?</p>

<span class="pagenum">192</span>
<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Nay, I have promis’d her, that you shall love her too,</p>
<p>Since both her Birth and Beauty merits you.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Away, false Woman: I love your Sister!</p>
<p>No, I will hate ye both.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Why so Angry?</p>
<p>Alas, it is against my Will I do it.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Did you betray my Faith, when ’twas so easy</p>
<p>To give a credit to your tale of Love?</p>
<p>&mdash;Oh Woman, faithless Woman!</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
<i>Alberto</i>, with a world of shame I own</p>
<p>That I then lov’d you, and must do so still:</p>
<p>But since that Love must be accounted criminal,</p>
<p>And that a world of danger does attend it;</p>
<p>I am resolv’d, though I can never quit it,</p>
<p>To change it into kind Esteem for you;</p>
<p>And would ally you, Sir, as near to me,</p>
<p>As our unkind Stars will permit me.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
I thank you, Madam: Oh, what a shame it is,</p>
<p>To be out-done in Virtue, as in Love!</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Another favour I must beg of you,</p>
<p>That you will tell <i>Antonio</i> what is past.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
How mean you, Madam?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Why, that I love you, Sir,</p>
<p>And how I have deceiv’d him into confidence.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
This is strange; you cannot mean it sure.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
When I intend to be extremely good,</p>
<p>I would not have a secret Sin within,</p>
<p>Though old, and yet repented too: no, Sir,</p>
<p>Confession always goes with Penitence.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Do you repent you that you lov’d me then?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Not so; but that I did abuse <i>Antonio</i>.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
And can you think that this will cure his Jealousy?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
Doubtless it will, when he knows how needless ’tis;</p>
<p>For when they’re most secure, they’re most betray’d:</p>
<span class="pagenum">193</span>
<p>Besides, I did but act the part he made;</p>
<p>And Ills he forces, sure he’ll not upbraid.</p>
<p>Go seek out <i>Antonio</i>.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
You have o’ercome me, Madam, every way,</p>
<p>And this your last Command I can obey;</p>
<p>Your Sister too I’ll see, and will esteem,</p>

<p>So soon my rising Love grew up to power,</p>

<p>&mdash;But I’ll omit the many visits paid,</p>
<p>Th’ unvalued Presents, and the Oaths he made,</p>
<p>My kind Disputes on all his Letters writ,</p>

<p>How oft he vow’d to marry me, whilst I</p>
<p>Durst not believe the pleasing Perjury:</p>
<p>&mdash;And only tell you, that one night he came,</p>
<p>Led by designs of an impatient Flame;</p>
<p>When all the House was silently asleep,</p>
<p>Except my self, who Love’s sad Watch did keep;</p>
<p>Arm’d with his Ponyard, and his Breast all bare,</p>
<p>His Face all pale with restless Love and Fear;</p>
<p>So many wild and frantick things he said,</p>

<p>So often vow’d he’d finish there his Life,</p>
<p>If I refus’d him to become his Wife;</p>
<p>That I half-dying, said it should be so;</p>
<p>Which though I fear’d, Oh, how I wish’d it too!</p>

’Tis truth, <i>Antonio</i>, I&nbsp;do love <i>Clarina;</i></p>
<p>And, what is yet far worse for thy repose,</p>
<p>Believe my self so bless’d to be belov’d.</p>

<p class="speaker">

All that you saw to day was only feign’d,</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
And now she thinks she is enough reveng’d;</p>

<p>That all your Sleights and Cunnings are but vain:</p>
<p>She has deceiv’d them all, and by that Art,</p>
<p>Gives you a Confidence, and me a Heart.</p>

I must confess, it is but just in her</p>

<p class="speaker">

<i>Clarina</i> happy, I’ll from Court retire,</p>

By all that’s good, she knew the Plot before,</p>
<p>From <i>Isabella</i>, who it seems o’erheard us,</p>
<p>When you once press’d me to’t:</p>
<p>And had we wanted Virtue, thoud’st been lost.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ant.</span>
I own the Crime;</p>
<p>And first I beg thy Pardon,</p>
<p>And after that will get it from <i>Clarina</i>;</p>
<p>Which done, I’ll wait upon thee to the Camp,</p>
<p>And suffer one year’s Penance for this Sin,</p>
<p>Unless I could divert this Resolution,</p>
<p>By a Proposal <i>Clarina</i> bid me make you.</p>

<p>Withdrew the Honour of your promis’d Friendship,</p>
<p>And made me partner in my Sister’s Fate;</p>
<p>Only with this difference, that she</p>
<p>You left to act a Murder on her self;</p>
<p>And mine you would have been so kind to’ve done</p>
<p>With your own hand, but my respect prevented it.</p>
<p>&mdash;Next, Sir, you ravish’d <i>Laura</i> from me,</p>
<p>And under a pretence of sacred Friendship,</p>
<p>You prov’d your self the worst of Enemies;</p>

<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
I see you’re in the dark, but I’ll unfold the Riddle,</p>
<p>&mdash;Sir, in the Passage from the Monastery,</p>
<p>Attended only by my Confessor,</p>
<p>A Gentleman, a Passenger, in the same Boat,</p>
<p>Address’d himself to me;</p>
<p>And made a many little Courtships to me:</p>
<p>I being veil’d, he knew not who receiv’d them,</p>
<p>Nor what Confusion they begot in me.</p>
<p>At the first sight, I grew to great esteems of him,</p>
<p>But when I heard him speak&mdash;</p>
<p>I’m not asham’d to say he was my Conqueror.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Oh, Madam, was it you?</p>
<p>Who by your Conversation in that Voyage,</p>
<p>Gave me Disquiets,</p>
<p>Which nothing but your Eyes could reconcile again?</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
’Twas I whom you deceiv’d with some such Language.</p>
<p>&mdash;After my coming home I grew more melancholy,</p>
<p>And by my silence did increase my Pain;</p>
<span class="pagenum">209</span>
<p>And soon <i>Clarina</i> found I was a Lover,</p>
<p>Which I confess’d at last, and nam’d the Object.</p>
<p>She told me of your Friendship with <i>Antonio</i>,</p>
<p>And gave me hopes that I again should see you:</p>
<p>&mdash;But <i>Isabella</i> over-heard the Plot,</p>
<p>Which, Sir, <i>Antonio</i> did contrive with you,</p>
<p>To make a feigned Courtship to <i>Clarina</i>,</p>
<p>And told us all the story.</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Alb.</span>
Oh, how I’m ravish’d with my Happiness!</p>

<p class="speaker">
<span class="speaker">Ism.</span>
<i>Clarina</i>, Sir, at first was much inrag’d,</p>
<p>And vow’d she would revenge her on <i>Antonio</i>;</p>
<p>But I besought her to be pleas’d again,</p>
<p>And said I would contrive a Counter-Plot,</p>
<p>Should satisfy her Honour and Revenge.</p>
<p>Thus, Sir, I got a Garment like to hers;</p>
<p>And to be courted, though but in jest, by you,</p>
<p>I run all hazards of my Brother’s Anger,</p>
<p>And your opinion of my Lightness too.</p>

<i>Great Johnson’s way.</i> cf. what Mrs. Behn says in her ‘Epistle to
the Reader’ prefacing <i>The Dutch Lover</i> (Vol. I, p.&nbsp;224), of
the Jonsonian enthusiast: ‘a man the most severe of Johnson’s Sect.’</p>

<i>Nokes and Angel.</i> The two celebrated low comedians. Angel died in
the spring of 1673. He was a great farceur, but gagged unmercifully, to
the no small annoyance of the poets.</p>

<p><a name="prince_commnote3" id="prince_commnote3" href="#prince_commtag3">p. 121</a>
<i>Cataline.</i> Jonson’s tragedy was revived with great splendour at
the King’s House, Friday, 18 December, 1668, and remained a stock play
until the retirement of Hart (who excelled in Catiline) at the Union in
1682. Michael Mohun was famous in Cethegus, and Mrs. Corey in Sempronia.
Pepys found the play itself rather dull as a whole ‘though most fine in
clothes, and a fine Scene of the Senate, and of a fight, as ever I saw
in my life.’ A&nbsp;year before its actual production his crony, Harry
Harris, a&nbsp;member of the rival theatre had ‘talked of
<i>Catiline</i> which is to be suddenly acted at the King’s House; and
there all agree that it cannot be well done at that house, there not
being good actors enough; and Burt acts Cicero, which they all conclude
he will not be able to do well. The King gives them £500 for robes,
there being, as they say, to be sixteen scarlet robes.’ (11 December,
1667.) In the first quarto (1672), of Buckingham’s <i>The Rehearsal</i>,
Bayes refers to <i>Catiline</i> saying that his design in a certain
scene is ‘<i>Roman</i> cloaths, guilded Truncheons, forc’d conceipt,
smooth Verse, and a Rant.’ The words ‘Roman cloaths’ are omitted in all
subsequent editions.</p>

<p><a name="prince_commnote4" id="prince_commnote4" href="#prince_commtag4">p. 121</a>
<i>the Comick Hat.</i> In 1670 there was produced at the Theatre Royal,
Dryden’s <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, Part <span class="smallroman">I</span>. The witty prologue was ‘spoken by Mrs. Ellen
Gwyn’ (who acted Almahide) ‘in a Broad-Brimm’d Hat, and Waist Belt’. It
commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>This jest was first of t’other house’s making,</p>
<p>And five times tried, has never fail’d of taking;</p>
<span class="pagenum notes">414</span>
<p>For ’twere a shame a poet should be kill’d</p>
<p>Under the shelter of so broad a shield.</p>
<p>This is the hat, whose very sight did win ye</p>
<p>To laugh and clap as tho’ the devil were in ye.</p>
<p>As then, for Nokes, so now I hope you’ll be</p>
<p>So dull, to laugh, once more, for love of me.</p>
</div>

<p>Two slightly different explanations are given of the jest. Theatrical
tradition has it that Dryden supplied Nell Gwynne, who was plump and
petite, with this hat of the circumference of a cart wheel, in ridicule
of a hat worn by Nokes of the Duke’s company whilst playing Ancient
Pistol. It is again said that in May, 1670, whilst the Court was at
Dover to receive the Duchess of Orleans, the Duke’s Company played there
Shadwell’s <i>The Sullen Lovers</i>, and Caryl’s <i>Sir Salomon; or, The
Cautious Coxcomb</i>, in which latter comedy Nokes acted Sir Arthur
Addle, a&nbsp;bawling fop. The dress of the French gallants attending
the Duchess was characterised by an excessively short laced scarlet or
blue coat, a&nbsp;very broad waist-belt and a wide-leaved hat. Nokes
appeared on the stage in a still shorter coat, a&nbsp;huger waist-belt,
and a hat of preposterous dimensions. The Duke of Monmouth buckled his
own sword to the actor’s side, and, according to old Downes, our
comedian looked more like a dressed-up ape or a quiz on the French than
Sir Arthur Addle. The English Court was straightway convulsed with
laughter at this mimicry, which seems, to say the least, in highly
questionable taste. When Nell Gwynne appeared and burlesqued the biter,
Charles II, who was present at the first performance of <i>The Conquest
of Granada</i>, well nigh died of merriment, and her verve in delivering
Dryden’s witty lines wholly completed her conquest of the King. Nell
Gwynne did not appear on the boards after 1670.</p>

<h4>Cross-Reference</h4>

<p><a name="prince_crossref5" id="prince_crossref5" href="#prince_commnote5">Note to p. 121</a>: <i>The Jig and Dance.</i></p>

<p><i>Town Fop</i> note:</p>

<div class="inset">
<p><i>A Jigg.</i> There were, in Post-Restoration times, two
interpretations of the word Jig. Commonly speaking it was taken to
mean exactly what it would now, a simple dance. Nell Gwynne and Moll
Davis were noted for the dancing of Jigs. cf. Epilogue to Buckingham’s
<i>The Chances</i> (1682):&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="indent2">The Author dreads the strut and meen</p>
<p>Of new prais’d Poets, having often seen</p>
<p>Some of his Fellows, who have writ before,</p>
<p>When Nel has danc’d her Jig, steal to the Door,</p>
<p>Hear the Pit clap, and with conceit of that</p>
<p>Swell, and believe themselves the Lord knows what.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus at the end of Lacy’s <i>The Old Troop</i> (31 July, 1668), we
have ‘a dance of two hobby horses in armour, and a Jig.’ Also shortly
before the epilogue in Shadwell’s <i>The Sullen Lovers</i> (1668) we
read, ‘Enter a Boy in the habit of Pugenello and traverses the stage,
takes his chair and sits down, then dances a Jig.’</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that beside the common meaning there was a
gloss upon the word derived from Elizabethan stage practice. In the
prologue to <i>The Fair Maid of the Inn</i> (licensed 1626), good plays
are spoken of as often scurvily treated, whilst</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>A Jigge shall be clapt at, and every rhime</p>
<p>Prais’d and applauded by a clam’rous chyme.</p>
</div>

<p>The Pre-Restoration Jig was little other indeed than a ballad opera
in
embryo lasting about twenty-five minutes and given as an after-piece.
It was a rhymed farce in which the dialogue was sung or chanted by the
characters to popular ballad tunes. But after the Restoration the Jig
assumed a new and more serious complexion, and came eventually to be
dovetailed with the play itself, instead of being given at the fag end
of the entertainment. Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Lawrence, the well-known theatrical
authority to whom I owe much valuable information contained in this
note, would (doubtless correctly) attribute the innovation to Stapylton
and Edward Howard, both of whom dealt pretty freely in these Jigs.
Stapylton has in Act v of <i>The Slighted Maid</i> (1663) a ‘Song in
Dialogue’ between Aurora and Phoebus with a chorus of Cyclops, which
met with some terrible parody in <i>The Rehearsal</i> (cf. the present
editor’s edition of <i>The Rehearsal</i>, p.&nbsp;145). Indeed all
extrinsic songs in dialogue, however serious the theme, were considered
‘Jigs’. A striking example would be the Song of the Spirits in Dryden’s
<i>Tyrannic Love</i>, Act&nbsp;iv.</p>

<p>In Post-Restoration days a ballad sung in the streets by two persons
was frequently called a Jig, presumably because it was a ‘song in
dialogue’. Numerous examples are to be found amongst the Roxburgh
Ballads.</p>

<p>The Jig introduced in <i>Sir Timothy Tawdrey</i> would seem to have
been the simple dance although not improbably an epithalamium was also
sung.</p>

traitor. This Council indeed is composed of a number of cowards and
rogues, who through sheer malice and carping jealousy attribute Bacon’s
prowess to his known passion for Semernia, the Indian Queen, and who
feign to think that he fights merely with the hope of slaying her
husband, the King Cavernio. These rascals are none the less mightily
afraid of the general’s valour and spirit, so they determine to entice
him from his camp under various specious pretexts, and then, once he is
completely in their power, to have him executed or assassinated. With
this object in view they send a friendly letter asking him to attend the
Council, to accept a regular commission, and to raise new forces. On his
way to the town Bacon is attacked by an ambush of soldiers, whom he
beats off with the help of one of his lieutenants, Fearless, backed by
Lieutenant Daring and a troop of his own men, who capture Whimsey and
Whiff, two very prominent justices, instigators of the plot. He
accordingly appears before the Council with a couple of prisoners. The
populace, who are all for their hero, realizing the treachery, raise a
riot, and throw the Councillors into a state of the utmost confusion and
alarm. They spur themselves to action, however, and under the leadership
of Colonel Wellman, Deputy Governor, proceed to take the field against
Bacon, who is declared an open and lawless rebel. When he appears the
soldiers, none the less, join themselves to their hero, and as at the
same moment news is brought that the Indians have risen and are
attacking the town, Bacon is induced to lead the troops against the foe;
and in a pitched battle Cavernio is slain. That night whilst his army is
revelling after their victory the Council and their party with infamous
treachery suddenly attack the camp. There are further skirmishes with a
remnant of the Indian fugitives, and in one of these frays Bacon
accidentally wounds Semernia, who is flying disguised in man’s attire.
He recognizes her voice, and she sinks into his <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘ams’">arms</ins> to die. As he is
weeping over her body Fearless rushes in with drawn sword shouting that
the day is all but lost. Bacon, his mistress dead, deeming that his men
are overcome by the attack from the town and that he will himself be
captured, takes poison which he carries concealed in the pommel of his
sword, whilst Daring and his soldiers are heard shouting ‘Victory!
Victory!’ The hero, however, expires at the moment his men have
conquered, but the Council speedily come to terms, naming with a
commission Daring as General, whilst Colonel Wellman announces his
intention of weeding this body of rogues and cowards against the arrival
of the new Governor who is expected from England.</p>

<span class="pagenum">218</span>
<p>Daring, upon his commission, is wedded to the Widow Ranter, first
mistress and then wife of old Colonel Ranter, recently deceased,
a&nbsp;wealthy, buxom virago who has followed her soldier during the
fighting in man’s attire and even allowed herself to be taken prisoner
by a young gallant, Hazard, just landed from England, and who has
occupied his time in an amour with a certain Mrs. Surelove. Hazard, upon
his arrival, meets an old acquaintance, Friendly, who loves and is
eventually united to Crisante, daughter to Colonel Downright; whilst
Parson Dunce, the Governor’s chaplain, is made to marry Mrs. Flirt, the
keeper of a hostelry, a&nbsp;good dame with whom he has been a little
too familiar on a promise of matrimony.</p>


<h4><a name="widow_source" id="widow_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> admirable comic scenes and
characters of <i>The Widow Ranter</i> are original invention, but Mrs.
Behn has founded the serious and historical portion of her play upon a
contemporary pamphlet, <i>Strange News from Virginia being a full and
true account of the Life and Death of Nathaniel Bacon esq. London:
printed for Wm. Harris, 1677</i>. With regard to the catastrophe and
Bacon’s love for the Indian Queen, Mrs. Behn has quite legitimately
departed from the narrative, but otherwise she keeps fairly closely to
her sources. There is also a <i>History of Bacon and Ingram’s Rebellion
in Virginia in 1675-76</i>, written at the time but first published in
1867.</p>

<p>The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> gives a very ample yet
concise account of Bacon, with valuable references to original
documents. He was the son of Sir Thomas Bacon of Friston Hall, Suffolk.
Born in 1642, about 1673 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward
Duke, Bart., and shortly afterwards in a spirit of roving adventure
emigrated to Virginia. Here he was elected a member of the Council, and
his estates being especially exposed to Indian raids the volunteer
colonists chose him General. The Governor, however, delayed to send the
necessary commission, and Bacon having in this interval attacked a band
of Indian marauders was promptly declared a rebel. The Governor was
thereupon forced to yield by a general revolt, and in a second
expedition Bacon defeated the Indians with terrific slaughter.
A&nbsp;little later when reinforcements had arrived the Governor again
declared him an outlaw, but after a brief struggle was himself obliged
to take refuge at sea, whilst Jamestown fell into the hands of the
victorious General, who not being able to garrison the houses, burned it
to the ground. In the midst of his success, whilst he was busied with
new plans for the welfare and protection of the colonists, Bacon died
suddenly, 1676. He left one daughter, Mary, who married Hugh
Chamberlain, M.D., physician to Queen Anne. Mrs. Behn has drawn his
character with remarkable accuracy. Even his enemies were obliged to
allow he possessed extraordinary ability, and he won all by the grace
and charm of his manner. Oldys, in a MS. note on Langbaine (Mrs. Behn),
attributes to the colonist <i>A&nbsp;Historical Discourse of the
Government of England</i> (1647), but the date of publication
sufficiently shows that the antiquary is palpably in error.</p>

<p>Langbaine in his note on <i>The Widow Ranter</i> abruptly and
sweepingly remarks ‘Plot from the known story of Cassius,’ which the
<i>Biographia
<span class="pagenum">219</span>
Dramatica</i> yet more erroneously expands as follows: ‘The tragedy part
of it, particularly the catastrophe of Bacon, is borrowed from the
well-known story of Cassius, who, on the supposition of his friend
Brutus being defeated, caused himself to be put to death by the hand of
his freedman Dandarus.’ C.&nbsp;Cassius Longinus was defeated at
Philippi (<span class="smallroman">B.C.</span> 42), by Antony, and
ignorant that the left wing commanded by Brutus had conquered Octavius,
he straightway commanded his freedman Pindarus to put an end to his
life. It is strange that both authorities should have made this mistake,
the more so as Bacon expressly alludes to the fate of Hannibal, from
whose history, and not that of Cassius, Mrs Behn doubtless borrowed the
idea of her hero’s suicide. Cassius is indeed alluded to but casually,
and not by Bacon’s self. Hannibal had fled to the court of Prusias, King
of Bithynia, who, unable to resist the demands of the Romans, eventually
sent troops to arrest his guest. The great Carthaginian, however, having
provided himself with poison in case of such an event, swallowed the
venomed drug to prevent himself falling into the hands of his enemies.
Dullman, Timorous Cornet, Whimsey, Whiff, and the other Justices of the
Peace who appear in this play are aptly described in <i>Oroonoko</i>,
where Mrs. Behn speaks of the Governor’s Council ‘who (not to disgrace
them, or burlesque the Government there) consisted of such notorious
villains as Newgate ever transported; and, possibly, originally were
such who understood neither the laws of God or man, and had no sort of
principles to make them worthy of the name of men; but at the very
council-table would contradict and fight with one another, and swear so
bloodily, that it was terrible to hear and see them. (Some of them were
afterwards hanged, when the Dutch took possession of the place, others
sent off in chains.)’</p>


<h4><a name="widow_hist" id="widow_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p>When <i>The Widow Ranter; or, The History of Bacon in Virginia</i>
was produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1690&mdash;the year
after Mrs. Behn’s death&mdash;owing to the slipshod and slovenly way in
which it was put on, or rather, ‘murdered’, to use the phrase of the
dedication, it did not meet with the success so capital a piece fully
deserved. Such ample and needless omissions were made that the intrigue
soon became hopelessly fogged, many incidents seeming absolutely
disjointed and superfluous. For not only were heavier scenes, including
the apparition of Cavernio, cut, but the essential comic relief was
woefully maltreated. The Court House opening of Act iii was expunged in
its entirety, whilst other episodes were so mangled and the speeches so
pruned that they proved practically unintelligible. Again, the play was
badly cast. Indifferent performers such as Barnes, Baker, Cudworth, were
entrusted with rôles they were incapable of acting, whilst Daring, the
dashing, gallant, and handsome young officer, who is loved by the Widow,
was alloted to Sanford, of all men most supremely unfitted for the part.
Indeed, it would seem that the casting was done on purpose perversely
and malignly to damn the play. Samuel Sanford, who had joined Davenant’s
company within a year of their opening, had been forced by nature, being
low of stature and crooked of person, rather than by choice, into a line
denoted by such characters as Iago, Creon in
<span class="pagenum">220</span>
Dryden and Lee’s <i>Oedipus</i>, Malignii, Osmund the wizard in <i>King
Arthur</i>. ‘An excellent actor in disagreeable characters’ Cibber terms
him, and old Aston sums him up thus: ‘Mr. <i>Sanford</i>, although not
usually deem’d an Actor of the first Rank, yet the Characters allotted
him were such, that none besides, then, or since, ever topp’d; for his
Figure, which was diminutive and mean, (being Round-shoulder’d,
Meagre-fac’d, Spindle-shank’d, Splay-footed, with a sour Countenance and
long lean Arms) render’d him a proper Person to discharge <i>Jago</i>,
<i>Foresight</i> and <i>Ma’lignij</i>, in the <i>Villain</i>.&mdash;This
Person acted strongly with his Face,&mdash;and (as King <i>Charles</i>
said) was the best <i>Villain</i> in the World.’ The performance of an
actor with such a marked personality and unpleasantly peculiar talents
as are thus enumerated, in the rôle of Daring must been grotesque and
distasteful to a degree. In such an accumulation of unfortunate
circumstances there could have been no other event than the failure of
the play, which was so complete as effectually to bar any chance of
subsequent revival. Indeed, there seems to have been only one feature of
any merit: Betty Currer, the original Aquilina in <i>Venice
Preserv’d</i>, acted the name part with the greatest spirit and
abandon.</p>

<a class="comm" name="widow_commtag1" id="widow_commtag1" href="#widow_commnote1"><span class="extended">MADAM
WELLDO</span>N</a>.</h4>

<p>Madam</p>

<p>Knowing Mrs. <i>Behn</i> in her Life-time design’d to Dedicate some
of her Works to you, you have a Naturall Title, and claim to this and I
could not without being unjust to her Memory, but fix your Name to it,
who have not only a Wit above that of most of your Sex; but a goodness
and Affability Extreamly Charming, and Engaging beyond Measure, and
perhaps there are few to be found like you, that are so Eminent for
Hospitallity, and a Ready and Generous Assistance to the distress’d and
Indigent, which are Quallities that carry much more of Divinity with
them, than a Puritannicall outward Zeal for Virtue and Religion.</p>

<p>Our Author, Madam, who was so true a Judge of Wit, was (no doubt of
it) satisfyed in the Patroness she had pitcht upon: If ever she had
occasion for a Wit and Sense like yours ’tis now, to Defend this (one of
the last of her Works) from the Malice of her Enemies, and the ill
Nature of the Critticks, who have had Ingratitude enough not to Consider
the Obligations they had to her when Living; but to do those Gentlemen
Justice, ’tis not (altogether) to be Imputed to their Critticism, that
the Play had not that Success which it deserv’d, and was expected by her
Friends; The main fault ought to lye on those who had the management of
it. Had our Authour been alive she would have Committed it to the Flames
rather than have suffer’d it to have been Acted with such Omissions as
was made, and on which the Foundation of the Play Depended: For Example,
they thought fit to leave out a Whole Scene of the <i>Virginian Court of
Judicature</i>, which was a lively resemblance of that Country-Justice;
and on which depended a great part of the Plot, and wherein were many
unusuall and very Naturall Jests which would at least have made some
sort of People laugh: In another Part of the Play is Omitted the
appearance of the Ghost of the <i>Indian King</i>, kill’d by
<i>Bacon</i>, and tho’ the like may have been Represented in other
Plays, yet I never heard or found but that the sight was very agreeable
to an Audience, and very Awfull: besides the Apparition of the Ghost was
necessary, for it was that which struck a Terror in the Queen, and
frighten’d her from heark’ning to the Love of <i>Bacon</i>, believing it
a horrid thing to receive the Caresses and Embraces of her Husbands
Murderer: And Lastly, many of the Parts being false Cast, and given to
<span class="pagenum">222</span>
those whose Tallants and Genius’s suited not our Author’s Intention:
These, Madam, are some of the Reasons that this Play was unsuccessfull,
and the best Play that ever was writ must prove so: if it have the Fate
to be Murder’d like this.</p>

<p>However, Madam, I can’t but believe you will find an hours diversion
in the reading, and will meet with not only Wit, but true Comedy, (tho’
low) by reason many of the Characters are such only as our
<i>Newgate</i> afforded, being Criminals Transported.</p>

<p>This play, Madam, being left in my hands by the Author to Introduce
to the Publick, I&nbsp;thought my self oblig’d to say thus much in its
defence, and that it was also a Duty upon me to choose a Patroness
proper for it, and the Author having pitcht upon your Name to do Honour
to some of her Works, I&nbsp;thought your Protection, could be so
usefull to none, as to this, whose owning it may Silence the Malice of
its Enemies; Your Wit and Judgment being to be Submitted to in all
Cases; Besides your Natural Tenderness and Compassion for the
Unfortunate, gives you in a manner another Title to it: The Preference
which is due to you upon so many Accounts is therefore the Reason of
this present Address, for at the Worst, if this Play should be so
Unfortunate as not to be thought worthy of your Acceptance; Yet it is
certain, that its worth any Man’s while to have the Honour of
subscribing himself,</p>

Porter’s</a>, <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag8" id="widow_texttag8" href="#widow_textnote8">I&nbsp;</a>ventur’d on, and
lost all. My elder Brother, an errant Jew, had neither Friendship nor
Honour enough to support me; but at last being mollified by Persuasions,
and the hopes of <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag9" id="widow_texttag9" href="#widow_textnote9">being</a> for ever rid of me,
sent me hither with a small Cargo to seek my Fortune&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
And begin the World withal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I thought this a better Venture than to turn sharping Bully, <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag10" id="widow_texttag10" href="#widow_textnote10">Cully in</a> Prentices and Country Squires, with my
Pocket full of false Dice, your <a class="comm" name="widow_commtag7" id="widow_commtag7" href="#widow_commnote7">high

the Death of their Fathers, and take Fees on both sides; or set up all
night at the Groom-Porter’s, begging his Honour to go a Guinea the
better of the lay. No, <i>Friendly</i>, I&nbsp;had rather starve abroad,
than live pity’d and despis’d at home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Thou art in the right, and art come just in the nick of time to make thy
Fortune.&mdash;Wilt thou follow my Advice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Thou art too honest to command <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag11" id="widow_texttag11" href="#widow_textnote11">any
thing</a> that I shall refuse.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
You must know then, there is about a Mile from <i>James-Town</i> a young
Gentlewoman&mdash;no matter for her Birth, her Breeding’s the best this
World affords, she is married to one of the richest Merchants here; he
is old and sick, and now gone into <i>England</i> for the recovery of
his Health, where he’ll e’en give up the Ghost: he has writ her word he
finds no Amendment, and resolves to stay another Year. The letter I
accidentally took up, and have about me; ’tis easily counterfeited, and
will be of great use to us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Now do I fancy I conceive thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Well, hear me first, you shall get another Letter writ like this
Character, which shall say, you are his Kinsman, that is come to
traffick in this Country, and ’tis his will you should be received into
his House as such.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Well, and what will come of this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Why, thou art young and handsome, she young and desiring; ’twere easy to
make her love thee; and if the old Gentleman chance to die, you guess
the rest, you are no Fool.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Ay, but if he shou’d return&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
If&mdash;Why, if she love you, that other will be but a slender Bar to
thy Happiness; for if thou canst not marry her, thou mayst lie with her:
and, Gad, a&nbsp;younger Brother may pick out a pretty Livelihood here
that way,
<span class="pagenum">229</span>
as well as in <i>England</i>. Or if this <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag12" id="widow_texttag12" href="#widow_textnote12">fail, thou</a> wilt find a perpetual Visiter, the
Widow <i>Ranter</i>, a&nbsp;Woman bought from the ship by old Colonel
<i>Ranter</i>; she served him half a Year, and then he marry’d her, and
dying in a Year more, left her worth fifty thousand Pounds Sterling,
besides Plate and Jewels: She’s a great Gallant, but assuming the humour
of the Country Gentry, her Extravagancy is very pleasant, she retains
something of her primitive Quality still, but is good-natur’d and
generous.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I like all this well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
But I have a further End in this matter; you must know there is in the
same House a young Heiress, one Colonel <i>Downright’s</i> Daughter,
whom I love, I&nbsp;think not in vain: her Father indeed has an
implacable Hatred to me, for which reason I can but seldom visit her,
and in this Affair I have need of a Friend in that House.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Me you’re sure of.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
And thus you’ll have an opportunity to manage both our Amours: Here you
will find occasion to shew your Courage, as well as express your Love;
for at this time the <i>Indians</i>, by our ill Management of Trade,
whom we have armed against our selves, very frequently make War upon us
with our own Weapons; though often coming by the worst, they are forced
to make Peace with us again, but so, as upon every turn they fall to
massacring us <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag13" id="widow_texttag13" href="#widow_textnote13">wherever</a> we lie exposed
to them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I heard the News of this in <i>England</i>, which hastens the new
Governour’s arrival here, who brings you fresh Supplies.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Would he were landed, we hear he is a noble Gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
He has all the Qualities of a Gallant Man: besides, he is nobly
born.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
This Country wants nothing but to be peopled with a well-born Race, to
make it one of the best Colonies in the World; but for want of a
Governour we are ruled
<span class="pagenum">230</span>
by a Council, some of <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag14" id="widow_texttag14" href="#widow_textnote14">whom</a> have been perhaps
transported Criminals, who having acquired great Estates, are now become
your Honour and Right Worshipful, and possess all Places of Authority;
there are amongst them some honest Gentlemen, who now begin to take upon
’em, and manage Affairs as they ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
<i>Bacon</i> I think was one of the Council.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Now you have named a Man indeed above the common Rank, by Nature
generous, brave, resolv’d and daring; who studying the Lives of the
<i>Romans</i> and great Men, that have raised themselves to the most
elevated Fortunes, fancies it easy for ambitious Men to aim at any pitch
of Glory. I’ve heard him often say, Why cannot I conquer the Universe as
well as <i>Alexander</i>? or like another <i>Romulus</i>, form a new
<i>Rome</i>, and make my self ador’d?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Why might he not? Great Souls are born in common Men sometimes, as well
as Princes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
This Thirst of Glory cherish’d by sullen Melancholy, I&nbsp;believe, was
the first motive that made him in love with the young <i>Indian</i>
Queen, fancying no Hero ought to be without his Princess. And this was
the reason why he so earnestly press’d for a Commission, to be made
General against the <i>Indians</i>, which long was promis’d him; but
they fearing his Ambition, still put him off, till the Grievances grew
so high, that the whole Country flock’d to him, and beg’d he would
redress them.&mdash;He took the opportunity, and led them forth to
fight, and vanquishing brought the Enemy to fair Terms; but now instead
of receiving him as a Conqueror, we treat him as a Traitor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Then it seems all the Crime this brave Fellow has committed, is serving
his Country without Authority.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
’Tis so, and however I admire the Man, I&nbsp;am resolv’d to be of the
contrary Party, that I may make an Interest in our new Governor. Thus
<a class="notes" name="widow_texttag15" id="widow_texttag15" href="#widow_textnote15">stand</a> Affairs, so that after you have seen Madam
<i>Surelove</i>, I’ll present you to the Council for a Commission.</p>

<span class="pagenum">231</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
But my Kinsman’s Character&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
He was a <i>Leicestershire</i> younger Brother, came over with a small
Fortune, which his Industry has increas’d to a thousand Pounds a year;
and he is now Colonel <i>John Surelove</i>, and one of the Council.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
About it then, Madam <i>Flirt</i> to direct you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
You are full of your Madams here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Oh! ’tis the greatest Affront imaginable to call a Woman Mistress,
though but a retail Brandy-monger. Adieu.&mdash;One thing more, to
morrow is our Country-Court, pray do not fail to be there, for the
rarity of the Entertainment: but I shall see you anon at
<i>Surelove’s</i>, where I’ll salute thee as my first meeting, and as an

Ay, so do I, ’tis for want of a little <i>Virginia</i> Breeding: how

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Nay, the Man will serve for both Soul and Body; for they say he was a
Farrier in <i>England</i>, but breaking, turn’d Life-guard-man, and his
Horse dying, he counterfeited a Deputation from the Bishop, and came
over here a substantial Orthodox. But come, where stands the Cup? Here,
my service to you, Major.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Flirt.</span>
Your Honours are pleased,&mdash;but methinks Doctor <i>Dunce</i> is a
very edifying Person, and a Gentleman, and I pretend to know a
Gentleman; for I my self am a Gentlewoman: my Father was a Baronet, but
undone in the late Rebellion, and I am fain to keep <a class="notes"

was but a broken Excise-Man, who spent the King’s Money to buy your Wife
fine Petticoats; and at last not worth a Groat, you came over a poor
Servant, though now a Justice of the Peace, and of the Honourable
Council.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
Hang ’em, Scoundrels, hang ’em, they live upon Scandal, and we are
Scandal-proof.&mdash;They say too, that I was a Tinker, and running the
Country, robb’d a Gentleman’s House there, was put into <i>Newgate</i>,
got a Reprieve after Condemnation, and was transported hither;

<a class="notes" name="widow_texttag24" id="widow_texttag24" href="#widow_textnote24">The Council-Table.</a></h4>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Wellman</em>, <em>Downright</em>, <em>Dunce</em>,
<em>Whimsey</em>, <em>Whiff</em>, and others.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Come, Mr. <i>Dunce</i>, though you are no Counsellor, yet your Counsel
may be good in time of Necessity, as now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
If I may <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag25" id="widow_texttag25" href="#widow_textnote25">give</a> worthy Advice,
I&nbsp;do not look upon our Danger to be so great from the
<i>Indians</i>, as from young <i>Bacon</i>, whom the People have
nick-nam’d <i>Fright-all</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Ay, ay, that same <i>Bacon</i>, I&nbsp;would he were well hang’d:
I&nbsp;am afraid that under pretence of killing all the <i>Indians</i>
he means to murder us, lie with our Wives, and hang up our little
Children, and make himself Lord and King.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Brother <i>Whimsey</i>, not so hot; with leave of the honourable Board,
my Wife is of opinion, that <i>Bacon</i> came seasonably to our Aid, and
what he has done was for our Defence, the <i>Indians</i> came down upon
us, and ravish’d us all, Men, Women, and Children.</p>

<span class="pagenum">236</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
If these Grievances were not redrest, we had our Reasons for it; it was
not that we were insensible, Captain <i>Whiff</i>, of what we suffer’d
from the Insolence of the <i>Indians</i>; but all knew what we must
expect from <i>Bacon</i>, if that by lawful Authority he had arrived to
so great a Command as General; nor would we be hufft out of our
Commissions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
’Tis most certain that <i>Bacon</i> did not demand a Commission out of a
design of serving us, but to satisfy his Ambition and his Love; it being
no secret that he passionately admires the <i>Indian</i> Queen, and
under the pretext of a War, intends to kill the King her Husband,
establish himself in her Heart, and on all occasions <a class="notes"
name="widow_texttag26" id="widow_texttag26" href="#widow_textnote26">make</a> himself a more formidable Enemy than the
Indians are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Nay, nay, I ever foresaw he would prove a Villain.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Nay, and he be thereabout, my <i>Nancy</i> shall have no more to do with
him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
But, Gentlemen, the People daily flock to him, so that his Army is too
considerable for us to oppose by any thing but Policy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
We are sensible, Gentlemen, that our Fortunes, our Honours, and our
Lives are at stake; and therefore you are call’d together to consult
what’s to be done in this Grand Affair, till our Governour and Forces
arrive from <i>England</i>: the Truce he made with the <i>Indians</i>
will be out to morrow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Ay, and then he intends to have another bout with the <i>Indians</i>.
Let’s have patience, I&nbsp;say, till he has thrumb’d their Jackets, and
then to work with your Politicks as soon as you please.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
Colonel <i>Wellman</i> has answer’d that point, good Captain
<i>Whiff</i>; ’tis the Event of this Battel we ought to dread; and if
won or lost, will be equally fatal for us, either from the
<i>Indians</i> or from <i>Bacon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
With the Permission of the honourable Board, I&nbsp;think I have hit
upon an Expedient that may prevent this Battel: your Honours shall write
a Letter to <i>Bacon</i>,
<span class="pagenum">237</span>
where you shall acknowledge his Services, invite him kindly home, and
offer him a Commission for General&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Just my <i>Nancy’s</i> Counsel&mdash;Dr. <i>Dunce</i> has spoken like a
Cherubin, he shall have my Voice for General; what say you, Brother
<i>Whimsey</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><a class="notes" name="widow_texttag27"
id="widow_texttag27" href="#widow_textnote27">Down.</a></span>
I say he is a Noble Fellow, and fit for a General.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
But conceive me right, Gentlemen; as soon as he shall have render’d
himself, seize him, and strike off his Head at the Fort.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Hum! his Head&mdash;Brother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Ay, ay, Dr. <i>Dunce</i> speaks like a Cherubin.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Mr. <i>Dunce</i>, your Counsel in extremity, I&nbsp;confess, is not
amiss; but I should be loth to deal dishonourably with any Man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
His Crimes deserve Death, his Life is forfeited by Law, but shall never
be taken by my consent by Treachery: If by any Stratagem we could take
him alive, and either send him for <i>England</i> to receive there his
Punishment, or keep him Prisoner here till the Governour arrive,
I&nbsp;should agree to it; but I question his coming in upon our
Invitation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
Leave that to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Come, I’ll warrant him, the Rogue’s as stout as <i>Hector</i>, he fears
neither Heaven nor Hell.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
He’s too brave and bold to refuse our Summons, and I am for sending him
for <i>England</i>, and leaving him to the King’s Mercy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
In that you’ll find more difficulty, Sir; to take him off here will be
more quick and sudden: for the People worship him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
I’ll never yield to so ungenerous an Expedient. The seizing him I am
content in the Extremity wherein we are to follow. What say you, Colonel
<i>Downright</i>? shall we send him a Letter now, while this two days
Truce lasts, between him and the <i>Indians</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
I approve it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
If your Honours please to make me the Messenger, I’ll use some Arguments
of my own to prevail with him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
You say well, Mr. <i>Dunce</i>, and we’ll dispatch you presently.</p>

<p class="stagedir">
Ex. <em>Well.</em> <em>Down.</em> and all but <em>Whim.</em>
<em>Whiff.</em> and <em>Dunce</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Ah, Doctor, if you could but have persuaded Colonel <i>Wellman</i> and
Colonel <i>Downright</i> to have hanged him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Why, Brother <i>Whiff</i>, you were for making him a General but
now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
The Counsels of wise States-men, Brother <i>Whimsey</i>, must change as
Causes do, d’ye see.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
Your Honours are in the right; and whatever those two leading
Counsellors say, they would be glad if <i>Bacon</i> were dispatch’d: but
the punctilio of Honour is such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Honour, a Pox on’t; what is that Honour that keeps such a bustle in the
World, yet never did good as I heard of?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
Why, ’tis a foolish word only, taken up by great Men, but rarely
practis’d.&mdash;But if you wou’d be great Men indeed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
<a class="notes" name="widow_texttag28" id="widow_texttag28" href="#widow_textnote28">If we wou’d</a>, Doctor, name, name the way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
Why, you command each of you a Company&mdash;when <i>Bacon</i> comes
from the Camp, as I am sure he will, (and full of this silly thing
call’d Honour, will come unguarded too) lay some of your Men in Ambush
along those Ditches by the <i>Sevana</i>, about a Mile from the Town;
and as he comes by, seize him, and hang him up upon the next Tree.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Hum&mdash;hang him! a rare Plot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Hang him!&mdash;we’ll do’t, we’ll do’t, Sir, and I doubt not but to be
made General for the Action&mdash;I’ll take it all upon my self.

Do you know, Brother, what we are to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
To do! yes, to hang a General, Brother, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
All! but is it lawful to hang any General?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Lawful, yes, that ’tis lawful to hang any General that fights against
Law.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
But in what he has done, he has serv’d the King and our Country, and
preserv’d our Lives and Fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
That’s all one, Brother; if there be but a Quirk in the Law offended in
this Case, though he fought like <i>Alexander</i>, and preserv’d the
whole World from Perdition, yet if he did it against Law, ’tis lawful to
hang him; why, what, Brother, is it fit that every impudent Fellow that
pretends to a little Honour, Loyalty, and Courage, should serve his King
and Country against the Law? no, no, Brother, these things are not to be
suffer’d in a civil Government by Law establish’d,&mdash;wherefore let’s

For the old Fellows, their business is Usury, Extortion, and undermining

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
As how, I pray?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
As thus: we have Men here of great Experience and Ability&mdash;now I
would have as many sent into <i>England</i>,

As for the old covetous Fellows, I&nbsp;would have the Tradesmen get in
their Debts, break and turn Troopers.</p>

As I designed&mdash;to present my self to the Council.</p>

By Heavens, we’ll follow then to save you from their Treachery, ’twas
this that has befallen you that I feared, which made me at a distance
follow you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bac.</span>
Follow me still, but still at such a distance as your Aids may be
assisting on all occasions.&mdash;<i>Fearless</i>, go back and bring
your Regiment down; and <i>Daring</i>, let your Sergeant with his Party
guard these Villains to the Council.

The Council-Table.</h4>

<p class="entrance">
Enter Col. <em>Wellman</em>, Col. <em>Downright</em>, <em>Dullman</em>,
<em>Timorous</em>, and about seven or eight more seat themselves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
You heard Mr. <i>Dunce’s</i> opinion, Gentlemen, concerning
<i>Bacon’s</i> coming upon our Invitation. He believes he will come, but
I rather think, though he be himself undaunted, yet the persuasions of
his two Lieutenant-Generals, <i>Daring</i> and <i>Fearless</i>, may
prevent him&mdash;Colonel, have you order’d our Men to be in Arms?</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter a <em>Soldier</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
I have, and they’l attend further order on the <i>Sevana.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sold.</span>
May it please your Honours, <i>Bacon</i> is on his way, he comes
unattended by any but his Footmen, and Col. <i>Fearless</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
Who is this Fellow?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
A Spy I sent to watch <i>Bacon’s</i> Motions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sold.</span>
But there is a Company of Soldiers in Ambush on this side of the
<i>Sevana</i> to seize him as he passes by.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
That’s by no order of the Council.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Omnes.</span>
No, no, no order.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Nay, ’twere a good design if true.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>

<p><span class="speaker">Brag.</span>
An’t please your Honours, the saddest News&mdash;an Ambush being laid
for <i>Bacon</i>, they rush’d out upon him on the <i>Sevana</i>, and
after some fighting took him and <i>Fearless</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Is this your sad News&mdash;zoors, wou’d I had had a hand in’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Brag.</span>
When on a sudden, <i>Daring</i> and his Party fell
<span class="pagenum">259</span>
in upon us, turn’d the tide&mdash;kill’d our Men, and took Captain

I’m of the Colonel’s Opinion, they deserve to hang for’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
Why, Brother, I thought you had <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag49" id="widow_texttag49" href="#widow_textnote49">wish’d that the Plot</a> had been yours but now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Ay, but the Case is alter’d since that, good Brother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Now he’s exasperated past all hopes of a Reconciliation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
You must make use of the Statesman’s Refuge, wise Dissimulation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Brag.</span>
For all this, Sir, he will not believe but that you mean honourably, and
no Persuasions could hinder him from coming, so he has dismiss’d all his
Soldiers, and is entring the Town on foot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
What pity ’tis a brave Man should be guilty of an ill Action.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Brag.</span>
But the noise of his danger has so won the Hearts of the Mobile, that
they increase his Train as he goes, and follow him in the Town like a
Victor.</p>

Go wait his coming.

I think the Offence needs not so great Punishment; their Crime, Sir, is

’Tis very well explained, Sir,&mdash;had I been murder’d by Commission
then, the Deed had been approved, and now perhaps I am beholding to the
Rabble for my Life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
A fine Pretence to hide a popular Fault, but for this once we pardon
them and you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bac.</span>
Pardon! for what? by Heaven, I&nbsp;scorn your Pardon, I’ve not offended
Honour nor Religion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
You have offended both in taking Arms.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bac.</span>
Should I stand by and see my Country ruin’d, my King dishonour’d, and
his Subjects murder’d, hear the sad Crys of Widows and of Orphans? you
heard it loud, but gave no pitying <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag50" id="widow_texttag50" href="#widow_textnote50">care</a> to’t, and till the War and Massacre was
brought to my own door, my Flocks and Herds surprized, I&nbsp;bore it
all with Patience. Is it unlawful to defend my self against a Thief that
breaks into my Doors?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
And call you this defending of your self?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bac.</span>
I call it doing of my self that right, which upon just demand the
Council did refuse me; if my Ambition, as you’re pleased to call it,
made me demand too much, I&nbsp;left my self to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Perhaps we thought it did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bac.</span>
Sir, you affront my Birth&mdash;I am a Gentleman, and yet my Thoughts

<em>Hazard</em> comes to the Board.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Brothers of the Bench, take notice, that this Hector here coming into
Mrs. <i>Flirt’s</i> Ordinary, where I was with my Brother <i>Dullman</i>
and Lieutenant <i>Boozer</i>; we gave him good Counsel to fall to work:
Now my Gentleman here was affronted at this, forsooth, and makes no more
to do but calls us Scoundrels, and drew his Sword on us; and had I not
defended my self by running away, he had murdered me, and assassinated
my two Brothers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
What Witness have you, Brother?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Here’s Mrs. <i>Flirt</i> and her Maid <i>Nell</i>,&mdash;besides, we may
be Witness for one another, I&nbsp;hope, our Words may be taken.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cler.</span>
Mrs. <i>Flirt</i> and <i>Nell</i> are sworn.
<span class="stagedir">
They stand forth.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
By the Oaths that you have taken, speak nothing but the truth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Flirt.</span>
An’t please your Worships, your Honours came to my House, where you
found this young Gentleman:
<span class="pagenum">268</span>
and your Honours invited him to drink with your Honours; Where after
some opprobrious Words given him, Justice <i>Dullman</i>, and Justice
<i>Boozer</i> struck him over the Head; and after that indeed the
Gentleman drew.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Mark that, Brother, he drew.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
If I did, it was <i>se defendendo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Do you hear that, Brothers, he did it in defiance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Sir, you ought not to sit Judge and Accuser too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
The Gentleman’s i’th’ right, Brother, you cannot do’t according to
Law.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Gads zoors, what new tricks, new querks?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Gentlemen, take notice, he swears in Court.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Gads zoors, what’s that to you, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
This is the second time of his swearing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
What, do you think we are deaf, Sir? Come, come, proceed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
I desire he may be bound to his Good Behaviour, fin’d, and deliver up
his Sword, what say you, Brother?
<span class="stagedir">
Jogs <em>Dull.</em> who nods.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
He’s asleep, drink to him and waken him,&mdash; you have miss’d the
Cause by sleeping, Brother.
<span class="stagedir">
Drinks.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
Justice may nod, but never sleeps, Brother&mdash; you were
at&mdash;Deliver his Sword&mdash;a&nbsp;good Motion, let it be done.
<span class="stagedir">
Drinks.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
No, Gentlemen, I wear a Sword to right my self.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
That’s fine, i’faith, Gads zoors, I’ve worn a Sword this dozen Year, and
never cou’d right my self.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Ay, ’twou’d be a fine World if Men should wear Swords to right
themselves; he that’s bound to the Peace shall wear no Sword.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
I say, he that’s bound to the Peace ought to wear no Peruke, they may
change ’em for black or white, and then who can know them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I hope, Gentlemen, I may be allowed to speak for my self.</p>

<span class="pagenum">269</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Ay, what can you say for your self, did you not draw your Sword,
Sirrah?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
’Tis sufficient, he confesses the Fact, and we’ll hear no more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
You will not hear the Provocation given.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
’Tis enough, Sir, you drew&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Ay, ay, ’tis enough, he drew&mdash;let him be fin’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
The Gentleman should be heard, he’s Kinsman too to Colonel <i>John
Surelove</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Hum&mdash;Colonel <i>Surelove’s</i> Kinsman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Is he so? nay, then all the reason in the World he should be heard,
Brothers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Come, come, Cornet, you shall be Friends with the Gentleman; this was
some drunken bout, I’ll warrant you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Ha, ha, ha, so it was, Gads zoors.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
Come, drink to the Gentleman, and put it up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Sir, my service to you, I am heartily sorry for what’s pass’d, but it
was in my drink.
<span class="stagedir">
Drinks.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
You hear his Acknowledgments, Sir, and when he’s sober he never
quarrels. Come, Sir, sit down, my Service to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I beg your excuse, Gentlemen&mdash;I&nbsp;have earnest business.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
Let us adjourn the Court, and prepare to meet the Regiments on the
<i>Sevana</i>.
<span class="stagedir">
All go but <em>Friend.</em> and <em>Hazard</em>.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Is this the best Court of Judicature your Country affords?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
To give it its due, it is not. But how does thy Amour thrive?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
As well as I can wish in so short a time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
I see she regards thee with kind Eyes, Sighs and Blushes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
Yes, and tells me I am so like a Brother she had
<span class="pagenum">270</span>
&mdash;to excuse her kind concern,&mdash;then blushes so prettily, that,
Gad, I&nbsp;cou’d not forbear making a discovery of my Heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Have a care of that, come upon her by slow degrees, for I know she is
virtuous;&mdash;but come, let’s to the <i>Sevana</i>, where I’ll present
you to the two Colonels, <i>Wellman</i> and <i>Downright</i>, the Men
that manage all till the arrival of the Governour.</p>

The <em>Sevana</em> or Heath.</h4>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Wellman</em>, <em>Downright</em>, <em>Boozer</em>, and
Officers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Have you dispatch’d the Scouts, to watch the Motions of the Enemies?
I&nbsp;know that <i>Bacon</i> is violent and haughty, and will resent
our vain Attempts upon him; therefore we must be speedy in
prevention.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
What Forces have you raised since our last order?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Booz.</span>
Here’s a List of ’em, they came but slowly in, till we promised every
one a Bottle of Brandy.</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Officer</em> and <em>Dunce</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Offi.</span>
We have brought Mr. <i>Dunce</i> here, as your Honour commanded us;
after strict search we found him this Morning in bed with Madam
<i>Flirt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
No matter, he’ll exclaim no less against the Vices of the Flesh the next
Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dun.</span>
I hope, Sir, you will not credit the Malice of my Enemies.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
No more, you are free, and what you counsell’d about the Ambush, was
both prudent and seasonable, and perhaps I now wish it had taken
effect.</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Friendly</em> and <em>Hazard</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
I have brought an <i>English</i> Gentleman to kiss your Hands, Sir, and
offer you his Service, he is young and brave, and Kinsman to Colonel
<i>Surelove</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Sir, you are welcome; and to let you see you
<span class="pagenum">271</span>
are so, we will give you your Kinsman’s Command, Captain of a Troop of
Horse-Guards, and which I’m sure will be continued to you when the
Governour arrives.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I shall endeavour to deserve the Honour, Sir.</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Dull.</em> <em>Tim.</em> <em>Whim.</em> and <em>Whiff</em>,
all in Buff, Scarf, and Feather.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
So, Gentlemen, I see you’re in a readiness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Readiness! What means he, I hope we are not to be drawn out to go
against the Enemy, Major.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
If we are, they shall look a new Major for me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
We were debating, Gentlemen, what course were best to pursue against
this powerful Rebel.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Why, Sir, we have Forces enough, let’s charge him instantly, Delays are
dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Why, what a damn’d fiery Fellow is this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
But if we drive him to extremities, we fear his siding with the
<i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
Colonel <i>Downright</i> has hit it; why should we endanger our Men
against a desperate Termagant; If he love Wounds and Scars so well, let
him exercise on our Enemies&mdash;but if he will needs fall upon us,
’tis then time enough for us to venture our Lives and Fortunes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
How, we go to <i>Bacon</i>! under favour, I&nbsp;think ’tis his duty to
come to us, an you go to that, Gads zoors.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
If he do, ’twill cost you dear, I&nbsp;doubt, Cornet.&mdash;I&nbsp;find
by our List, Sir, we are four thousand Men.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Gads zoors, not enough for a Breakfast for that insatiate <i>Bacon</i>,
and his two Lieutenant Generals, <i>Fearless</i> and <i>Daring</i>.

<em>Whiff</em> sits on the Ground with a Bottle of Brandy.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
A Morsel, a Morsel.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
I am for an attack, what say you, Gentlemen, to an attack?&mdash;What,
silent all? What say you, Major?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
I say, Sir, I hope my Courage was never in dispute. But, Sir, I&nbsp;am
going to marry Colonel <i>Downright’s</i>
<span class="pagenum">272</span>
Daughter here&mdash;and should I be slain in this Battle ’twould break
her Heart;&mdash;besides, Sir, I&nbsp;should lose her Fortune.

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
I’m sure here’s a Captain will never flinch.

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Who, I, an’t like your Honour?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Ay, you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Who, I? ha, ha, ha: Why, did your Honour think that I would fight?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Fight! yes; why else do you take Commissions?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Commissions! Oh Lord, O Lord, take Commissions to fight! ha, ha, ha;
that’s a jest, if all that take Commissions should fight&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Why do you bear Arms then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>
Why, for the Pay; to be called Captain, noble Captain, to show, to cock
and look big, and bluff as I do: to be bow’d to thus as we pass, to
domineer and beat our Soldiers: Fight, quoth a, ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
But what makes you look so simply, Cornet?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Why, a thing that I have quite forgot, all my Accounts for
<i>England</i> are to be made up, and I’m undone if they be
neglected&mdash;else I wou’d not flinch for the stoutest he that wears a
Sword&mdash;
<span class="stagedir">
Looking big.</span></p>

What say you, Captain <i>Whiff</i>?
<span class="stagedir">
<em>Whiff</em> almost drunk.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
I am trying, Colonel, what Mettle I’m made on; I&nbsp;think I am
valiant, I&nbsp;suppose I have Courage, but I confess <a class="notes"
name="widow_texttag56" id="widow_texttag56" href="#widow_textnote56">’tis a little of the D&mdash;&mdash; breed</a>, but
a little inspiration from the Bottle, and the leave of my <i>Nancy</i>,
may do wonders.</p>

Enter a <em>Seaman</em> in haste.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sea.</span>
An’t please your Honours, <i>Frightall’s</i> Officers have seiz’d all
the Ships in the River, and rid now round the Shore, and had by this
time secur’d the sandy Beach, and landed Men to fire the Town, but that
they are high

me to let your Honours know, that a few Men sent to his assistance will
surprize them and retake the Ships.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Now, Gentlemen, here is a brave occasion for Emulation&mdash;why writ
not the Master?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>
Ay, had he writ, I had soon been amongst them, i’faith; but this is some
Plot to betray us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sea.</span>
Keep me here, and kill me if it be not true.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
He says well&mdash;there’s a Brigantine and a Shallop ready, I’ll embark
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
No, Sir, your Presence is here more necessary, let me have the Honour of
this Expedition.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Haz.</span>
I’ll go your Volunteer, <i>Charles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Who else offers to go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whim.</span>

writ.</p>

Ay, ay, if he had writ&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
I see you’re all base Cowards, and here cashier ye from all Commands and
Offices.</p>

Look ye, Colonel, you may do what you please, but you lose one of the
best dress’d Officers in your whole Camp, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
And in me, such a Head-piece.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
I’ll say nothing, but let the State want me.</p>

The Scene opens and discovers a Body of Soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Why, Mr. Parson, I have a scruple of Conscience upon me, I&nbsp;am
considering whether it be lawful to kill, though it be in War;
I&nbsp;have a great aversion to’t, and hope it proceeds from
Religion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Whiff.</span>
I remember the Fit took you just so when the <i>Dutch</i> besieged us,
for you cou’d not then be persuaded to strike a stroke.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Tim.</span>
Ay, that was because they were Protestants as we are; but, Gads zoors,

Gentlemen Soldiers, Merchants, Planters, and whom else it may concern.
Whereas <i>Bacon</i>, contrary to Law and Equity, has, to satisfy his
own Ambition, taken up Arms with a pretence to fight the <i>Indians</i>,
but indeed to molest and enslave the whole Colony, and to take away
their Liberties and Properties; this is to declare, that whoever shall
bring this Traitor dead or alive to the Council, shall have three

Successful <i>Daring</i>, welcome, what Prizes have ye?</p>

The fairest in the World, Sir; I’m not for common Plunder.</p>

Hah, my Daughter and my Kinswoman!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bac.</span>
’Tis not with Women, Sir, nor honest men like you, that I intend to
combat; not their own Parents <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag59" id="widow_texttag59" href="#widow_textnote59">shall be</a> more indulgent, nor better Safe-guard

their most valued Prizes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
But, Sir, I know your wild Lieutenant General has long lov’d my

consent.</p>

I own I have a Passion for <i>Chrisante</i>, yet by my General’s Life,

Believe me, Ladies, you shall have honourable Treatment here.</p>

We do not doubt it, Sir, either from you or <i>Daring</i>; if he love
me, that will secure my Honour; or if he do not, he’s too brave to
injure me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dar.</span>
I thank you for your just opinion of me, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chris.</span>
But, Sir, ’tis for my Father I must plead; to see his reverend Hands in
servile Chains; and then perhaps, if stubborn to your Will, his Head
must fall a Victim to your Anger.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Down.</span>
No, my good pious Girl, I cannot fear ignoble usage from the General;
and if thy Beauty can preserve thy Fame, I&nbsp;shall not mourn in my

I’ll ne’er deceive your kind opinion of me&mdash;Ladies, I&nbsp;hope
you’re all of that Opinion too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Chris.</span>
Do your worst, Sir: I give you leave, if you assail me only with your

A Temple, with an <em>Indian</em> God placed upon it, Priests and
Priestesses attending: Enter <em>Indian King</em> on one side attended
by <em>Indian</em> Men; the <em>Queen</em> enters on the other with
Women. All bow to the Idol, and divide on each side of the Stage. Then
the Musick playing louder, the <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag60" id="widow_texttag60" href="#widow_textnote60">Priests</a> and Priestesses dance about the Idol
with ridiculous Postures, and crying (as for Incantations) thrice

After this soft Musick plays again: then they sing something fine: after
which the Priests lead the <em>King</em> to the Altar, and the
Priestesses the <em>Queen</em>; they take off little Crowns from their
Heads, and offer them at the Altar.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">King.</span>
Invoke the God of our <a class="comm" name="widow_commtag26" id="widow_commtag26" href="#widow_commnote26">Quiocto</a> to declare what

Soft Musick ceases.</span></p>

The Musick changes to confused Tunes, to which the Priests and

before; and then dance again, and so invoke again alternately: Which

What means <i>Semernia</i>? why are thy Looks so pale?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
Alas, the Oracles have double meanings, their Sense is doubtful, and
their Words Enigmas: I&nbsp;fear, Sir, I&nbsp;cou’d make a truer
Interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">King.</span>
How, <i>Semernia</i>! by all thy Love I charge thee, as you respect my
Life, to let me know your Thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
Last Night I dream’d a Lyon fell with hunger, spite of your Guards, slew
you, and bore you hence.</p>

This is thy Sex’s fear, and no Interpretation of the Oracle.</p>

I cou’d convince you farther.</p>

Hast thou a Secret thou canst keep from me? thy Soul a Thought that I

Come unriddle me the Oracle.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
The <i>English</i> General shall be a Captive to his Enemy; he is so,
Sir, already, to my Beauty, he says he languishes for Love of me.</p>

Hah! the General my Rival&mdash;but go on&mdash;</p>

Alas! What pity ’tis I saw the General, before my Fate had given me to

implore the Deities, methinks my Prayers should not ascend the Skies,

my Heart and Soul, loves <i>Chrisante</i>, has stolen her, and carried

him conceited? no, instead of snivelling I am resolved&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen.</span>
What, Madam?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ran.</span>
Gad, to beat the Rascal, and bring off <i>Chrisante</i>.</p>

Beat him, Madam! what, a Woman beat a Lieutenant-General?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ran.</span>
Hang ’em, they get a name in War from Command, not Courage; but how know
I but I may fight? Gad, I&nbsp;have known a Fellow kick’d from one end
of the Town to t’other, believing himself a Coward; at last forced to
fight, found he could; got a Reputation, and bullied all he met with;
and got a Name, and a great Commission.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen.</span>
But if he should kill you, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ran.</span>
I’ll take care to make it as comical a Duel as the best of ’em; as much
in love as I am, I&nbsp;do not intend to die its Martyr.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. Whiff.</span>
Lord, you need not have been so hasty.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Friend.</span>
Do not upbraid me with your Eyes, <i>Chrisante</i>; but let these Wounds
assure you I endeavour’d to serve you, though <i>Hazard</i> had the
Honour on’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
But, Ladies, we’ll not expose you in the Camp,&mdash;a&nbsp;Party of our

Ay, ay, let the Enemy say how I maul’d ’em&mdash;but Gads zoors,

<p><span class="speaker">Well.</span>
Since you’ve regain’d your Honour so gloriously, I&nbsp;restore you to
your Commands you lost by your seeming Cowardice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dull.</span>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
I tremble yet, dost think we’re safe, <i>Cavaro</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cav.</span>
Madam, these Woods are intricate and vast, and ’twill be difficult to

fear of being taken.</p>

<span class="pagenum">299</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
Dost think if <i>Bacon</i> find us, he will not know me? Alas, my Fears

<p><span class="speaker">Ana.</span>
’Tis certain, Madam, if we stay we perish; for all the Wood’s surrounded
by the Conqueror.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
Alas, ’tis better we should perish here, than stay to expect the
Violence of his Passion, to which my Heart’s too sensibly inclin’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ana.</span>
Why do you not obey its Dictates then? why do you fly the Conqueror?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
Not fly&mdash;not fly the Murderer of my Lord?</p>

What World, what Resolution can preserve you? and what he cannot gain by

compel me:&mdash;For Oh, <i>Anaria</i>&mdash;I&nbsp;adore this

conceal’d&mdash;at twelve Years old&mdash;at the <a class="notes" name="widow_texttag75" id="widow_texttag75" href="#widow_textnote75"><i>Pauwomungian</i></a> Court, I&nbsp;saw this
Conqueror. I&nbsp;saw him young and gay as new-born Spring, glorious and
charming as the Mid-day’s Sun; I&nbsp;watch’d his Looks, and listned
when he spoke, and thought him more than mortal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ana.</span>
He has a graceful Form.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
At last a fatal Match concluded was between my Lord and me; I&nbsp;gave
my Hand, but oh, how far my Heart was from consenting, the angry Gods
are Witness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ana.</span>
’Twas pity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Queen.</span>
Twelve tedious Moons I pass’d in silent Languishment; Honour
endeavouring to destroy my Love, but all in vain; for still my Pain
return’d whenever I beheld my Conqueror; but now when I consider him as
Murderer of my Lord&mdash;
<span class="aside">Fiercely.</span>
I&nbsp;sigh and wish&mdash;some other fatal Hand had given him his

March, 1678, and it is printed with all copies of that play. It was, no

assigns precisely the same meaning. D’Urfey, however, <i>Pills to Purge

<i>trusting for old Oliver’s Funeral broke.</i> The obsequies of Oliver
Cromwell, originally fixed for 9 November, 1658, owing to the
extraordinary magnificence of the preparations were not performed until
23 November. For many days his waxen effigy, dressed in robes of state,
was exhibited at Somerset House. The expenses totalled £60,000, and it
was a public scandal that a great part of this wanton and wasteful
extravagance remained unpaid, to the undoing of the undertakers. On 25
August, 1659, in the <i>Kalendar of State Affairs (Domestic)</i>, the
following occurs: ‘Report by the Committee appointed by Parliament to
examine what is due for mourning for the late General Cromwell, that on
perusal of the bills signed by Cromwell’s servants, and of the account
of Abr. Barrington, his auditor, it appears that £19,303 0<i>s.</i>
11<i>d.</i> is still due and unpaid for mourning. Also that Nath.
Waterhouse, servant to Rich. Cromwell, should be authorized to see the
persons in a list [missing] annexed for that mourning. Col. Rich to make
this report. Schedule of debts due to 11 mercers and drapers for the
funeral of the late General Cromwell. Total £19,303 0<i>s.</i>

<i>Agah Yerkin.</i> The various dictionaries and vocabularies of the
Indian languages I have had resource to give none of these words. There
is, however, so great a confusion of Indian jargons and dialects that
they cannot be pronounced fictitious. Yet Mrs. Behn would hardly, even
if she had learned the language, have retained any exact knowledge of
such barbaric tongues, and one may almost certainly say that these cries
and incantations are her own composition. Amongst other authorities I
have consulted <i>The Voyage of Robert Dudley ... to the West
Indies</i>, 1594-5, edited by G.&nbsp;F. Warner for the Hakluyt Society
(1889). Dr. Brinton’s <i>Arawack Language of Guiana</i>, an exhaustive
monograph, (Philadelphia, 1871.) M.&nbsp;M. Crevaux, Sagot,
L.&nbsp;Adam, <i>Grammaires et
<span class="pagenum notes">418</span>

<p><a name="widow_commnote26" id="widow_commnote26" href="#widow_commtag26">p. 279</a>
<i>Quiocto.</i> Mrs. Behn probably meant to spell this word
‘Quiyoughcto’, the sound being identical. There is in Virginia a river
which in the seventeenth century was called the ‘Quiyough’. The
inhabitants of the banks of this river had mysterious or supernatural
properties ascribed to them. <i>In the Voyages &amp; Discoveries of
Capt. John Smith</i> (1606), we have: ‘They thinke that their Werowanees
and Priests, which they also esteeme Quiyoughcosughes, when they are
dead, doe goe beyond the mountaines towards the setting of the sun.’ No
doubt Mrs. Behn knew this passage. I&nbsp;owe the above interesting note
to the kindness of my friend Mr. Gosse.</p>

<i>Flambeaux.</i> Mrs. Behn (or, haply, George Jenkins, the first editor
of <i>The Widow Ranter</i>), here uses the ordinary form ‘flambeaux’ as
a plural. In <i>The Emperor of the Moon</i> (Vol. III, p.&nbsp;418), she
writes ‘a Flambeaux’. In addition to the example from Herbert which I
give in my note (Vol. III, p.&nbsp;475), I&nbsp;find a plural
‘Flambeaux’s’ used by Mrs. Manley. cf. <i>Secret Memoirs &amp; Manners
of Several Persons of Quality of Both Sexes from the New Atalantis</i>
(1709, the Second Edition), Vol. I, p.&nbsp;88: ‘She but thinks of an
expensive Funeral, white Flambeaux’s, Chariots, Horses, Streamers, and a

<i>Epilogue.</i> This Epilogue is, it will be noted, almost precisely
the same as the Prologue to <i>Abdelazer</i>. In line 32 we have
‘Basset’ in place of the obsolescent game, ‘Beasts’ (damn’d Beasts).
Basset, which resembled Faro, was first played at Venice. cf. Evelyn’s
<i>Diary</i>, 1645 (Ascension Week at Venice): ‘We went to the Chetto de
San Felice, to see the noblemen and their ladies at basset, a&nbsp;game
at cards which is much used.’ It became immensely popular in England.
Evelyn, in his famous description of ‘the inexpressible luxury and
profaneness, gaming, and all dissoluteness’ on the Sunday se’nnight
before the death of Charles II, specially noted that ‘about twenty of
the great courtiers and other dissolute persons were at Basset round a
large table, a&nbsp;bank of at least 2000 in gold before them.’

<h4><a name="brother_arg" id="brother_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>

<p><span class="firstword">Mirtilla</span>, the Amorous Jilt, who had
once been attached to George Marteen, the Younger Brother, married for a
convenience the clownish Sir Morgan Blunder. Prince Frederick, who had
seen and fallen in love with her during a religious ceremony in a Ghent
convent, follows her to England. They meet accidentally and she promises
him a private interview. George Marteen had recommended a page to
Mirtilla, and the lad is his sister Olivia in disguise. Mirtilla,
although she falls in love with her ‘smooth-chin’d boy’, receives Prince
Frederick, but the house wherein she lodges catches fire that night, and
it is George Marteen who, in spite of the fact that he knows his friend
the Prince is with her, procures a ladder and rescues the lady at some
danger to himself. The Prince is able to escape by the same way, and he
then carries Mirtilla to his own lodgings, where feigning to be ill with
fatigue and terror she begs her lover to leave her to repose. This is
done with the idea of entertaining her page, and on Frederick’s approach
she conceals Olivia, who thus creeps off unseen, beneath the train of
her gown, whilst she herself retires with the amorous Prince. None the
less, Mirtilla still pursues Olivia, and eventually Frederick discovers
she is a wanton jilt, as he surprises her leading the page to her bed.
He is, however, reconciled when Mirtilla discovering to her amaze that
the lad is a woman reveals this fact to the Prince to confound him, but
afterwards avowing her frailty, throws herself on Frederick’s
generosity. Olivia has been promised by her old father, Sir Rowland
Marteen, to Welborn, whom she has never seen. On meeting Welborn she
falls in love with him, without knowing who he is, and he, also, whilst
ignorant of her name, is soon enamoured of her in turn. Prince Frederick
lodges in the same house as Welborn and it is hither that after the fire
she attends Mirtilla. Welborn, supposing her to be Mirtilla’s page, out
of kindness offers her half his bed, which for fear of arousing
suspicion she is bound to accept. She slips away, however, before
daybreak, leaving a letter for her companion, by which he learns that
the page is none other than the lady whom he had seen in the Mall.
Welborn and Olivia are eventually married. George Marteen’s elder
brother, Sir Merlin, a&nbsp;boon companion of Sir Morgan Blunder, is a
rakehelly dog, who leads a wild town life to the great anger of old Sir
Rowland. George, who whilst secretly leading a gay life under the name
of Lejere, appears before his father as a demure and sober young
prentice, is designed for Lady Youthly, an ancient, toothless crone,
palsied and blind with extreme old age, whose grand-daughter, Teresia,
is to be married to Sir Rowland himself. George, however, falls in love
with Teresia, who is also pursued by Sir Merlin, and finally weds her in
despite of his father, brother and the beldame. But Sir Rowland shortly
relents and even forgives his eldest son, who has married Diana, the
cast off mistress of a gambler, whilst Lady Youthly is left to the
tender consolations of her chaplain.</p>

<h4><a name="brother_source" id="brother_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>

<p><i>The Younger Brother; or, The Amorous Jilt</i> was written (in
great part at least) by Mrs. Behn a good many years before her death,
after which it was brought on the stage under the auspices of Gildon, in
1696; and in the Epistle Dedicatory he expressly says ‘all the
Alterations which I made were in the first Act, in removing that old
bustle about <i>Whigg</i> and <i>Tory</i> (which was the subject of most
of the Second Scene) and placing the Character of a <i>Rake-hell</i> in
its room.’ Mrs. Behn probably wrote the first Act sometime about the
years 1681-3, when there was a continual ‘rout with Whigging and with
Torying’, and afterwards completed the remainder at her leisure. In his
notice of this comedy Langbaine’s editor (Gildon), who finds Mirtilla
‘genteel’, says that Astrea took a portion of the plot ‘from a true
story of the brother of Col. Henry Martin, and a Lady that must be
nameless. See the Novel call’d <i>Hatige</i>.’ <i>Hattige: or, the
Amours of the King of Tamaran. A&nbsp;Novel</i>, by Gabriel de Brémond,
was translated in 1680. (12mo. For Simon the African: Amsterdam, [R.
Bentley? London.]) A&nbsp;biting satire on Charles II and Lady
Castlemaine, the tale is told with considerable spirit and attained
great vogue. Another edition was issued in 1683, and under the title
<i>The Beautiful Turk</i> it is to be found in <i>A&nbsp;Select
Collection of Novels</i> (1720 and 1729), Vol. III. This novel had first
appeared anonymously at Cologne in 1676&mdash;<i>Hattigé ou la Belle
Turque, qui contient ses amours avec le roi Tamaran</i>&mdash;and Nodier
in his <i>Mélanges d’une petite Bibliothèque</i> describes a ‘clef’.
Hattigé is, of course, Lady Castlemaine; Tamaran, Charles II; and the
handsome Rajeb with whom the lady deceives the monarch, Jack Churchill.
It is a wanton little book, and at the time must have been irresistibly
piquant. Beyond the likeness between the characters of Mirtilla and
Hattigé the novel has, however, little in common with Mrs. Behn’s play.
Gildon’s comment is, of course, founded upon the passage in
<i>Oroonoko</i> which says: ‘We met on the river with Colonel Martin,
a&nbsp;man of great gallantry, wit and goodness, and whom I have
celebrated in a character of my new comedy by his own name in memory of
so brave a man.’</p>

<p>In D’Urfey’s <i>The Royalist</i>, an excellent comedy produced at
Dorset Garden, 1682 (4to, 1682), the author introduces a certain damsel
Philippa, who, disguised as a page, follows the loyal Sir Charles
Kinglove with whom she is enamoured. At the end of the second Act her
boy’s clothes involve her in the same predicament as befalls Olivia in
Act iv of <i>The Younger Brother</i>. Although Genest prefers Mrs.
Behn’s treatment of the situation, it must, I&nbsp;think, be allowed
that D’Urfey has managed the jest with far greater verve and spirit.
Honest Tom D’Urfey is in fact one of the least read and most maligned of
all our dramatists. He had the merriest comic gifts, and perhaps when
the critics and literary historians deign to read his plays he will
attain a higher position in our theatrical libraries.</p>

<p>Some critics have suggested that D’Urfey, in his <i>The Intrigues at
Versailles</i>, produced at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 1697, may have taken a
hint
<span class="pagenum">315</span>
from Mrs. Behn’s Mirtilla, and Wycherley’s Olivia (<i>The Plain
Dealer</i>) for his ‘Madame de Vandosme a right jilt in all humours’,
a&nbsp;rôle created by Mrs. Barry. There is indeed some resemblance
between all these three characters, base heartless coquettes; and
D’Urfey, in making his jilt prefer Sir Blunder Bosse, ‘a dull sordid
brute and mongrel, whose humour is to call everybody by clownish names’,
to all her other gallants, seems not to have forgotten Mirtilla’s
marriage with Sir Morgan Blunder. The very names call attention to the
plagiarism. <i>The Intrigues at Versailles</i> is none the less a clever
and witty comedy, but a little overcrowded with incident and
business.</p>


<h4><a name="brother_hist" id="brother_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p>As sufficiently explained by Gildon, under whose auspices this
posthumous play was produced at Drury Lane in 1696, <i>The Younger
Brother; or, The Amorous Jilt</i> met with brutal treatment from the
audience. There appears to have been a faction, particularly in evidence
at its first performance and on the third day, who were steadfastly
resolved to damn the comedy, and in spite of fine acting and every
advantage it was hissed from the boards. Gildon attributes the failure
to ‘the tedious Scenes in Blank Verse betwixt Mirtilla and Prince
Frederick’ which he thinks demanded ‘another more easy Dress,’ but, in
truth, it can only be attributed to the most verjuiced spite and
personal malice. The plot, though somewhat complicated with perhaps a
press of crowding incidents, is none the less highly interesting, and
the characters are most of them excellently, all well, drawn and
sustained. The fact that certain episodes had to be cut in
representation in order to bring the comedy within a reasonable time
limit, though it may have tended to obscure the connection of the
intrigue, could not have insured in spite of its many real merits so
absolute a doom for the much maltreated play, a&nbsp;sentence which
seems to have wantonly precluded any revival.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> unjust Sentence this Play met
with before very partial Judges in the Acting, will, I’m pretty sure, be
revers’d by the more unprejudiced Readers, and it’s evident, Merit will
exert itself so far, as to justify my Presumption in Dedicating it,
notwithstanding its small success, to you, Sir, for whom I must always
profess the highest Esteem and Value, sprung from that Nobleness of your
Nature that takes a God-like Delight in redressing the Misfortunes of
’em, more than fly to you for their unhappiness; a&nbsp;generous Soul
indeed, never gives a greater Proof of her Excellence, than in her
Protection of the Unfortunate; for tho suffering Merit challenges a
Regard from all, yet it meets with it from none but such as you, Sir,
who are so Eminent for that Vertue, which more than all the rest,
commands the Esteem and Veneration of the Thinking World, your
Generosity I mean, Sir, which gives the most Perfect Touches of that
likeness, man can have to his Almighty Original; for those are but
scurvey awkard Copies of Him that want it. ’Tis, I&nbsp;may say, the
very Essence of God, Who with our <i>Beings</i>, dispenses the grateful
Knowledge of Himself in the Benefits He bestows.</p>

<p><a class="notes" name="brother_texttag2" id="brother_texttag2"
href="#brother_textnote2">The narrow Virtues of the Old Philosophers,
[which] were</a> rather Vices, if winnow’d well, form’d to gratify their
Proud, Lazy, Superiority, at the Expence of all the Publick Duties
incumbent on mankind, whom they pretend to Purge from his Passions, to
make him happy, by that means to amuse our Curiosity with Chymera’s,
whilst we lost our real Good, will still naturally flow from those
Springs of Pleasure, Honour, Glory, and Noble Actions, the Passions
given us by Heaven for our common Good. But their own Practice generally
shew’d the Vanity of their Emperic Boasts, when they Buried all the
Nobler Pleasures of the Mind in Avarice, and Pedantick Pride, as
<i>Lucian</i> has pleasantly made out in <i>Hermotimus</i>.</p>

<p>Those Notional Excellencies that divert us from, or weaken a Publick
Spirit, are always False and Hypocritical, that under a gaudy out-side
conceals a rotten Carcass, full of Infectious Distempers that destroy
the noblest end of our Being, <i>The doing good to one another</i>.
Vanity has always been the Refuge of little Souls, that place their
Value in a False Greatness, Hyppocrisie, and great Titles. What a
seeming Holiness does for the
<span class="pagenum">317</span>
Avaritious, Designing Saint; Titles do for the proud Avarice of the meer
Man of Quality, cheaply Purchasing a Respect from the many; but ’tis the
Generous man only that fixes himself in the Hearts of the most valuable
part of mankind, when proper Merit only is esteem’d, and the Man, not
his Equipage, and Accidental Appurtenances respected.</p>

<p>The Application of this, I shall leave to all that know you, Sir, who
are all sensible what Virtues you make your Darlings, and choice of
Virtue shews the Nobleness of our Temper, as much as Choice of Friends,
the degrees of our Understandings; and if that be true that most Men
choose those Virtues which are nearest a-kin to their Darling Vices, I’m
sure ’twill be a strong proof, that ev’n your Failings (for ev’ry Man
has his share of them too) are more Beneficial to the world than the
Vertues of a numerous part of Mankind. In Collonel <i>Codrington</i>
indeed, we find the true Spirit and Bravery of old <i>Rome</i>, that
despises all dangers, that in the Race of Glory thou art the Noble
Chace. Nor can the manly Roughness of your Martial Temper (Fierce to
none but your Countries Foes) destroy that ingaging sweetness your
agreeable Conversation abounds with, which heightened with so large a
share of Wit, Learning, and Judgment, improves as well as delights; so
that to have known you any way, must give us some advantage or other.
This it was that encourag’d me to dedicate this Play, Sir, to you, of
which I may venture to say more, and with more assurance, than if it had
been my own.</p>

<p>Mrs. BEHN was a Woman so Accomplish’d, and of so Established a Fame
among the Men of Sense, that I cou’d not suppose a very severe treatment
from the Town, which has been very indulgent to the Performances of
others; especially when, besides the Reputation of the <i>Author</i>,
the Play itself had an Intrinsic Merit; for we find it full of Humour,
Wit, and Variety; the Conversation Gay and Genteel, the Love Soft and
Pathetic, the incidents Natural, and Easy, and the Conduct of the Plot
very Justifiable. So that I may reasonably impute its miscarriage to
some Faction that was made against it, which indeed was very Evident on
the First day, and more on the endeavours employed, to render the
Profits of the Third, as small as could be.</p>

<p>It suffer’d not, I’m sure, in the Action, nor in <a class="comm"
name="brother_commtag2" id="brother_commtag2" href="#brother_commnote2">Mr. <i>Verbruggen’s</i> reading of some of his
Part</a>, since he lost nothing of the Force of Elocution, nor
Gracefulness of Action; nor indeed can I, with Justice to my self,
impute it to any part that I ventur’d to add to the Original; for all
the Alterations which I made were in the first Act, in removing that old
bustle about <i>Whigg</i> and <i>Tory</i>, (which was the Subject of
most of the Second Scene) and placing the Character of a
<i>Rake-hell</i> in its room, which was so little, that it could not
Influence a more Capricious Audience, to the
<span class="pagenum">318</span>
Damning of the whole. There might indeed be some objections about the
Plot, but not very Rational, I&nbsp;think; I’m sure, at least, ’tis the
first Play, for some Years, could be quarrell’d at for having too much
Plot. In the Edition however I have put in a great deal, which the
length of the Play oblig’d me to cut out for the Action.</p>

<p>Here, Sir, if the Play had been my own, I&nbsp;should have complain’d
that the Town had its favourite Fools, as well as favourite Wits, and
that Comedy or Farce from any other hand wou’d no more go down with
them, than their favourites will with true Judges that read, not see
’em. I&nbsp;should have had indignation enough, perhaps, to’ve rail’d at
the Criticks of all Degrees, and Denominations of Box and Pit, nay,
Galleries too, and told ’em that they were so conceited of their own
Wit, that they cou’d take no pleasure in hearing that of another, or
that Wit in a Play seeming to affront the Parts of the Audience, they
suffer’d their Resentment to destroy their Satisfaction. This, and a
great many other Satyrical Reflections, which are natural for a
Disappointed Poet to make, I&nbsp;shou’d then have vented; but being
satisfy’d, that the Reputation of Mrs. BEHN is not affected by the
malicious Endeavours of some of my Enemies, I&nbsp;now present it under
your Patronage, Sir, to the more competent Judges; Proud of the
Opportunity of Offering you an occasion of so agreeable a Province, as
the Protection of the unfortunate, and letting the World know how much I
am, Sir,</p>

Enter <em>Olivia</em> in a Page’s Habit. She runs and embraces
<em>George</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
My ever charming Brother!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
My best, my dear <i>Olivia</i>!</p>

<span class="pagenum">323</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
The same lovely Man still! Thy Gallantry and Beauty’s all thy own;
<i>Paris</i> could add no Graces to thy Air; nor yet pervert it into
Affectation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Spare me, and tell me how <i>Mirtilla</i> fares.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
I think, Brother, I writ you word to Paris, of a Marriage concluded
betwixt me and <i>Welborn</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
That Letter I receiv’d: but from the dear <i>Mirtilla</i>, not one soft
word; not one tender Line has blest my Eyes, has eas’d my panting Heart
this tedious three Months space; and thou with whom I left the weighty
Charge of her dear Heart, to watch her lovely Eyes, to give me notice
when my Rivals press’d, and when she waver’d in her Faith to me, even
thou wert silent to me, cruel Sister.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Thou wilt be like a Lover presently, and tire the Hearer with a Book of
Words, of heavy Sighs, dying Languishments, and all that huddle of
Nonsense; and not tell me how you like my Marriage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
<i>Welborn’s</i> my Friend, and worthy of thy Heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
I never saw him yet; and to be sold unseen, and unsigh’d for, in the
Flower of my Youth and Beauty, gives me a strange aversion to the
Match.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Oh! you’ll like him when you see him&mdash;But my
<i>Mirtilla</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Like him&mdash;no, no, I never shall&mdash;what, come a Stranger to my
Husband’s Bed? ’Tis Prostitution in the leudest manner, without the
Satisfaction; the Pleasure of Variety, and the Bait of Profit, may make
a lame excuse for Whores, who change their Cullies, and quit their
nauseous Fools&mdash;No, no, my Brother, when Parents grow arbitrary,
’tis time we look into our Rights and Privileges; therefore, my dear
<i>George</i>, if e’er thou hope for Happiness in Love, assist my
Disobedience.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
In any worthy Choice be sure of me; but canst thou wish Happiness in
Love, and not inform me something of <i>Mirtilla</i>?</p>

<span class="pagenum">324</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
I’ll tell you better News&mdash;our hopeful elder Brother, Sir
<i>Merlin</i>, is like to be disinherited; for he is, Heaven be
thanked&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Marry’d to some Town-Jilt, the common fate of Coxcombs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Not so, my dear <i>George</i>, but sets up for a celebrated Rake-hell,
as well as Gamester; he cou’d not have found out a more dextrous way to
have made thee Heir to four Thousand Pounds a Year.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
What’s that without <i>Mirtilla</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Prithee no more of her&mdash;Love spoils a fine Gentleman: Gaming,
Whoring and Fighting may qualify a Man for Conversation; but Love
perverts all one’s Thoughts, and makes us fit Company for none but one’s
self; for even a Mistress can scarce dispense with a <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘fighing’">fighting</ins>, whining
Lover’s Company long, though all he says flatters her Pride.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Why dost thou trifle with me, when thou knowest the Violence of my
Love?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
I wish I could any way divert your Thoughts from her, I&nbsp;would not
have your Joy depend on such a fickle Creature.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
<i>Mirtilla</i> false! What, my <i>Mirtilla</i> false!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Even your <i>Mirtilla’s</i> false, and married to another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Married! <i>Mirtilla</i> married! ’Tis impossible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Nay, married to that bawling, drinking Fool, Sir <i>Morgan
Blunder</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Married, and married to Sir <i>Morgan Blunder</i>! a&nbsp;Sot, an
ill-bred senseless Fool; almost too great a Fool to make a Country
Justice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
No doubt, she had her Aims in’t, he’s a very convenient Husband, I’ll
assure you, and that suits her Temper: he has Estate and Folly enough,
and she has Youth and Wantonness enough to match ’em.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Her Choice gives me some Comfort, and some Hopes; for I’ll pursue her,
but for Revenge, not Love.</p>

<span class="pagenum">325</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Forget her rather, for she’s not worth Revenge, and that way ’twill be
none; prostitute in Soul as Body, she doats even on me in Breeches.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
On thee, her Page? doat on thee, a&nbsp;Youth! she knew thee not as
Woman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
No, that Secret I have kept to do you Service.&mdash;At first she said
she lov’d me for your sake, because you recommended me; and when I sung,
or plaid upon my Flute, wou’d kiss my Cheek, and sigh, and often (when
alone) wou’d send for me, and smile, and talk, and set my Hair in Curls,
to make me saucy and familiar with her. One Day she said,
<i>Endimion</i>, thy Name-sake was thus caress’d by <i>Cynthia</i>:
A&nbsp;Goddess did not scorn the humble Swain, whom by her Love she
equal’d to her Deity. She found that I had Sense to understand her, and
paid her Advances back with equal Ardour.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Oh, Curse! where learnt she all this Wickedness?
<span class="stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
But she being oblig’d to go for <i>Flanders</i>, to see her Sister take
the holy Habit, I&nbsp;feign’d a Sickness to be left behind, hoping that
Absence might abate her Flame; yet she return’d more amorous, and
fearing the Thefts of Love might wound her Honour, she thought a Husband
would secure that Shame; and luckily my Aunt arriv’d from <i>Wales</i>,
and brought Sir <i>Morgan</i> with her, who lodging where we did, at
Mrs. <i>Manage’s</i>, my Aunt (that doats on Quality in either Sex) made
up this hasty Match, unknown to me, though for my sake.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
What will not faithless Woman do, when she is raging?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
And now having so well prepar’d the way, she grows impatient for an
Opportunity; and thou art arriv’d, most happily to succour me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
No, for some days keep this habit on, it may be useful to us; but I must
see this faithless perjur’d Woman, which I must contrive with Mrs.
<i>Manage</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum">326</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Yet pray resolve to see my Father first; for now’s the critical time to
make thy Fortune: he came to Town last night, and lodges here at Mrs.
<i>Manage’s</i>, with my Aunt <i>Blunder</i>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
What, in the House with thee, and not know thee?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
No more than a Priest Compassion; he thinks me at <i>Hackney</i>,
<a class="comm" name="brother_commtag4" id="brother_commtag4" href="#brother_commnote4">making Wax Babies</a>, where he intends to visit me
within these three days,&mdash;But I forgot to tell you, our Brother,
Sir <i>Merlin</i>, lodges in this House with you; and shou’d he know
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
’Tis impossible&mdash;I’ve not see him, or my Father, these five Years.
Absence, my Growth, and this unexpected Equipage, will not be penetrated
by his Capacity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
True, he’ll never look for his Brother <i>George</i>, in the Gallantry
and Person of Monsieur <i>Lejere</i>&mdash;My good Father expects you
home, like the prodigal Son, all torn and tatter’d, and as penitent
too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
To plod on here, in a laborious Cheating, all my Youth and Vigour, in
hopes of drunken Pleasures when I’m old; or else go with him into
<i>Wales</i>, and there lead a thoughtless Life, hunt, and drink, and
make love to none but Chamber-maids. No, my <i>Olivia</i>, I’ll use the
sprightly Runnings of my Life, and not hope distant Pleasures from its
Dregs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
For that, use your Discretion; now equip your self to your present
Business; the more simply you are clad and look, the better. I’ll home
and expect you.
<span class="stagedir">
Exit.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Do so, my good Sister; a little formal Hypocrisy may do, ’twill relish
after Liberty; for a Pleasure is never so well tasted, as when it’s
season’d with some Opposition.</p>

<p class="entrance">
Enter <em>Britton</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Britt.</span>
Sir, I’ve News to tell you, will surprize you; Prince <i>Frederick</i>

<p class="entrance">
Enter Prince <em>Frederick</em>; they meet and embrace.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
My Life’s Preserver, welcome to my Arms as Health to sick Men.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><a class="notes" name="brother_texttag7"
id="brother_texttag7" href="#brother_textnote7">Prince.</a></span>
And thou to mine as the kind Mistress to the longing Lover; my Soul’s
Delight, and Darling of the Fair.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Ah Prince! you touch my bleeding Wound.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><a class="notes" href="#brother_textnote7">Prince.</a></span>
Ha, <i>Lejere</i>! leave to unhappy Lovers those Sighs, those folded
Arms, and down-cast Eyes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Then they are fit for me; my Mistress, Sir, that Treasure of my Life,
for whom you’ve heard me sigh, is perjur’d, false, and married to
another. Yet what is worse, I&nbsp;find my Prince, my Friend, here in my
native Country, and am not able to pay him what his Greatness
merits.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><a class="notes" href="#brother_textnote7">Prince.</a></span>
You pain me when you compliment my Friendship.
<span class="stagedir">
Embracing.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Perhaps you will not think me worth this Honour, when you shall hear my
Story.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Thou canst say nothing I can value less.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Perhaps too my way of Living has deceiv’d you, being still receiv’d by
Princes, as Companions in all their Riots, Loves, and Divertisements;
where ev’n you did me the Honour to esteem, and call me Friend.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Whate’er thou art, I’m sure thy Mind’s illustrious.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
My Family, I must confess, is honourable; but, Sir, my Father was the
younger House, of which my unhappy self was destin’d to be last: I’m a
<i>Cadet</i>, that Out-cast of my Family, and born to that curse of our
old <i>English</i> Custom. Whereas in other Countries, younger Brothers
are train’d up to the Exercise of Arms, where
<span class="pagenum">328</span>
Honour and Renown attend the Brave; we basely bind our youngest out to
Slavery, to lazy Trades, idly confin’d to Shops or Merchants Books,
debasing of the Spirit to the mean Cunning, how to cheat and
chaffer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
A Custom insupportable!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
To this, to this low wretchedness of Life, your Servant, Sir&mdash;was
destin’d by his Parents, and am yet this bound indentur’d Slave.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Thou hast no cause to quarrel with thy Stars, since Virtue is most
valu’d when opprest&mdash;Are all your Merchants Apprentices thus
gay?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Not all&mdash;but, Sir, I could not bow my Mind to this so necessary
Drudgery; and yet however, I&nbsp;assum’d my native Temper, when out
o’th’ Trading City; in it, I&nbsp;forc’d my Nature to a dull slovenly
Gravity, which well enough deceiv’d the busy Block-heads; my Clothes and
Equipage I lodg’d at this End of the Town, where I still pass’d for
something better than I was, whene’er I pleas’d to change the Trader for
the Gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
And liv’d thus undiscover’d&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
With Ease, still lov’d and courted by the Great, ever play’d high with
those durst venture most; and durst make Love where’er my Fancy lik’d:
but sometimes running out my Master’s Cash, (which was supply’d still by
my Father) they sent me, to reform my expensive Life, a&nbsp;Factor,
into <i>France</i>&mdash;still I essay’d to be a plodding Thriver, but
found my Parts not form’d for dirty Business.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
There’s not a Thought, an Action of thy Soul, that does not tend to
something far more glorious.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
If yet you think me worthy of your Favour, command that Life you have so
oft preserv’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
No more;&mdash;Thou hast increas’d my Value for thee.&mdash;Oh! take my
Heart, and see how’t has been us’d by a fair Charmer, since I saw thee
last&mdash;That sullen day we parted, you for <i>England</i>, you may
remember I design’d for <i>Flanders</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum">329</span>
<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
I do, with Melancholy, Sir, remember it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Arriv’d at <i>Ghent</i>, I&nbsp;went to see an <i>English</i> Nun
initiated, where I beheld the pretty Innocent, deliver’d up a Victim to
foolish Chastity; but among the Relations, then attending the Sacrifice,
was a fair Sister of the young Votress, but so surpassing all I’ad seen
before, that I neglecting the dull holy Business, paid my Devotion to
that kneeling Saint.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
That was the nearest way to Heaven, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Her Face, that had a thousand Charms of Youth, was heighten’d with an
Air of Languishment; a&nbsp;lovely Sorrow dwelt upon her Eyes, that
taught my new-born-Passion Awe and Reverence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
This Description of her fires me.&mdash;
<span class="stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Her dimpl’d Mouth, her Neck, her Hand, her Hair, a&nbsp;Majesty and
Grace in every Motion, compleated my Undoing; I&nbsp;rav’d,
I&nbsp;burnt, I&nbsp;languish’d with Desire, the holy Place cou’d scarce
contain my Madness: with Pain, with Torture, I&nbsp;restrain’d my
Passion when she retir’d, led sadly from the Altar. I, mixing with the
Croud, enquir’d her Name and Country; her Servant told me, that she was
of Quality, and liv’d in <i>England</i>, nay, in this very Town: this
gave me Anguish not to be conceiv’d, till I resolv’d to follow her,
which is the cause you find me here so soon. Thy Aid, thy Aid,
<i>Lejere</i>, or I am lost.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
I wish to live no longer than to serve your Highness: if she be, Sir,
a&nbsp;Maid of Quality, I&nbsp;shall soon find her out, and then you’ll
easily conquer. You’ve all the Youth, and Beauty, that can charm; and
what gains most upon a Woman’s Heart, you’ve a powerful Title, Sir,<a

win. But you’ve not told me yet the Lady’s Name.</p>

The <i>Town-Rake</i>; written by <a class="comm" name="brother_commtag6" id="brother_commtag6" href="#brother_commnote6">Mr. <i>Motteux</i></a>.</h5>

<h5>I.</h5>

<div class="song">
<p>What Life can compare with the jolly Town-Rake’s,</p>
<p>When in Youth his full Swing of all Pleasure he takes?</p>
<p>At Noon, he gets up, for a Whet, and to dine,</p>
<p>And wings the dull Hours with Mirth, Musick and Wine;</p>
<p>Then jogs to the <em>Play-house</em>, and chats with the Masks,</p>
<p>And thence to <a class="comm" name="brother_commtag7" id="brother_commtag7" href="#brother_commnote7">the <em>Rose</em></a>,
where he takes his three Flasks.</p>

<p>And <a class="comm" name="brother_commtag8" id="brother_commtag8" href="#brother_commnote8">scours</a> all he meets,
as he reels to his Punk;</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<div class="song">
<p>He, like the <em>Great Turk</em>, has his Favourite She;</p>

<p>Sometimes she’s a Lady; but as he must range,</p>
<p><em>Black-Betty</em>, or <em>Oyster-Doll</em>, serves for a

<p>As he varies his Sports, his whole Life is a Feast;</p>

<p>He dwells in a Tavern, and lies ev’ry where,</p>
<p>And improving his hours, lives an Age in a Tear:</p>
<span class="pagenum">332</span>

My honest Country-Couz. when wilt thou understand the <i>Guelphs</i>,

talk Treason o’ this side the Law? bilk a Whore without remorse; break
Windows, and not pay for ’em; drink your Bottle without asking
Questions; kill your Man without letting him draw; play away your Money
without fear of your Spouse, and stop her Mouth by undermining her
Nose?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Come, come, look you, Cousin, one word of Advice now I’m sober; what the

Wit! I&nbsp;had rather be one of your Rakehells: for, look ye,
a&nbsp;Man may swear and stare, or so; break Windows, and Drawers Heads,
or so; unrig a needy Whore, and yet keep one’s Estate: but should I turn
Wit, ’twere impossible; for a Wit with an Estate is like a Prisoner
among the Cannibals.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
How so, good Sir <i>Morgan</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Why, the needy Rogues only feed him with Praise, to fatten him for their
Palates, and then devour him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
I applaud your choice, Cousin; for what Man of Bravery wou’d not prefer
a Rake to a Wit? The one enjoys the Pleasures the other can only rail
at; and that not out of Conscience, but Impotence: for alas! a&nbsp;Wit
has no quarrel to Vice in Perfection, but what the
<span class="pagenum">334</span>
Fox had to the Grapes; he can’t play away his hundred Pound at sight;
<a class="comm" name="brother_commtag12" id="brother_commtag12" href="#brother_commnote12">his Third Day</a> won’t afford it; and therefore
he rails at Gamesters; Whores shun him, as much as Noblemen, and for the
same cause, Money; those care not to sell their Carcases for a Sonnet,
nor these to scatter their Guineas, to be told an old Tale of a Tub,
they were so well acquainted with before.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
What’s that, Sir <i>Merlin</i>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Why, their Praise;&mdash;for the Poet’s Flattery seldom reaches the
Patron’s Vanity; and what’s too strong season’d for the rest of the
World, is too weak for their Palates.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Why, look ye, Cousin, you’re a shreud Fellow: Whence learn’d you this
Satire? for I’m sure ’tis none of thy own; for I shou’d as soon suspect
thee guilty of good Nature, as Wit.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
I scorn it; and therefore I confess I stole the Observation from a Poet;
but the Devil pick his Bones for diverting me from the noble Theme of
Rakehells.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Noble Theme, Sir <i>Merlin</i>! look ye, d’ye see: Don’t mistake me,
I&nbsp;think ’tis a very scurvy one; and I wou’d not have your Father
know that you set up for such a Reprobate; for Sir <i>Rowland</i> would
certainly disinherit thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
O, keep your musty Morals to your self, good Country Couz; they’ll do
you service to your <i>Welch</i> Criminals, for stealing an Hen, or
breaking up a Wenches Inclosure, or so, Sir <i>Morgan</i>; but for me,
I&nbsp;despise ’em: I&nbsp;have not been admitted into the Family of the
<i>Rakehellorums</i> for this, Sir: Let my Father drink old <a class="comm" name="brother_commtag13" id="brother_commtag13" href="#brother_commnote13"><i>Adam</i></a>, read the <i>Pilgrim’s
Progress</i>, <a class="comm" name="brother_commtag14" id="brother_commtag14" href="#brother_commnote14"><i>The Country
Justice’s Calling</i></a>, or for a Regale, drink the dull Manufacture
of Malt and Water; I&nbsp;defy him; he can’t cut off the Entail of what
is settled on me: and for the rest, I’l trust Dame <i>Fortune</i>; and
pray to the Three Fatal Sisters to cut his rotten Thred in two, before
he thinks of any such Wickedness.</p>

What’s the matter! the disturbance! Why, Sister, this Rogue

for a Rakehell, when there’s scarce such a thing in the Nation, above an
Ale-draper’s Son; and chuses to be aukardly out of fashion, merely for

profane, lazy, idle, noisy, groveling Rascals, purely for the sake of

Hold, hold, good Uncle; my Cousin has been only drawn in, a&nbsp;little

<p><span class="speaker">L. Blun.</span>
Whores! ay, filthy Creatures; do they deal in Whores? Pray, Cousin,
what’s a Rake-hell?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Row.</span>
A Rake-hell is a Man that defies Law and good Manners, nay, and good
Sense too; hates both

Morality and Religion, and that not for any Reason (for he never thinks)
but merely because he don’t understand ’em: He’s the Whore’s Protection

Property, the Drawer’s Terror, the Glasier’s Benefactor; in short,
a&nbsp;roaring, thoughtless, heedless, ridiculous, universal
Coxcomb.</p>

Why, Aunt, I say a Rake-hell is your only Man of Bravery; he slights all
the Force of Fortune, and sticks at no Hazard&mdash;plays away his
hundred Pounds at sight, pays a Lady’s Bill at sight, drinks his Bottle
without equivocation, and fights his Man without any Provocation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Sir Row.</span>
Nay then, Mr. Rogue, I’ll be sworn thou art none: Come, Sir, will you
fight, Sir? will you fight, Sir? Ha!

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Oh, my dear <i>Teresia</i>, I’m lost in Love! I’ve seen a Man,&mdash;or
rather ’tis an Angel! so gay, so soft, so charming, and so witty; so
dress’d! so shap’d! and danc’d with such an Air!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
Hey day! Prithee where’s this Wonder to be seen?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Why dost thou ask? Hast thou not seen a Man of Dress, and Movement of

A great many, very odd, and fantastick, I’m sure my dear Man is none of
’em.

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
Thy Heart when fir’d burns easily, and soft, but I am all impatient,
Darts, and Flames, and all the effects of Love are panting in my Heart,
yet never saw his Face: but see, he comes, and I must find a way to let
him know the mischiefs he has done.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mir.</span>

Do you wait near me to Night, I&nbsp;may perhaps have kinder Business

<p><span class="speaker">Oliv.</span>
You heap too many Blessings on me, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Prince.</span>
Oh, turn thy lovely Eyes upon thy Slave, that waits and watches for a

<p><span class="speaker">Mir.</span>
Oh, Sir, why do you press a yielding Heart too much, undone by what

Love and Fortune.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Two very good Friends of mine, prithee who art thou that bring’st

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
A wandring Nymph, that has had a swinging Character of your Person and

thy Face; and if I’m not mistaken, ’tis ten to one, but we may go near
to strike up some odd Bargain or other.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
And I am as likely a Fellow for some odd Bargain or other, as ever you
met with&mdash;Look ye, am I the Man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
Let me see&mdash;a very handsome Face, inclining to round; fine wanton
Eyes, with a plaguy Roguish Lear; plump, round, red Lips; not tall, nor
low, and extremely
<span class="pagenum">356</span>
well fashion’d.

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Why, any Woman that’s pretty, witty, young, and good-natur’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
I had rather shew anything almost than my Face.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Faith, and that’s kind; but every thing in its due time: I&nbsp;love to
arrive at Happiness by degrees, there’s as much Pleasure in the Journey
of Love, as in the Arrival to’t, and the first Stage is a handsom
Face.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
Where you bait a while, take a short Survey, and away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
To Wit, and good Humour; where a Man finds Pleasure enough to engage him
a long while.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
Then to all the small Villages, call’d little Freedoms, Kissing,
Playing, Fooling, Sighing, Dying&mdash;and so on to the last Stage,
where Whip and Spur laid by, all tir’d and dull, you lazily lie down and
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
No, I’m a more vigorous Lover: And since in <a class="comm" name="brother_commtag18" id="brother_commtag18" href="#brother_commnote18">the Country of True Love</a> there remains a
<i>Terra Incognita</i>, I&nbsp;shall always be making new

<p><span class="speaker">Ter.</span>
True Love! is there such a thing in the whole Map of Nature?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
Yes, I once discover’d it in my Voyage round the World.</p>

You never knew a Woman thrive so well by real Love, as by Dissimulation:
This has a thousand Arts and Tricks to conquer; appears in any Shape, in
any Humour; can laugh or weep, be coy or play, by turns, as suits the
Lover best, while simple Love has only one Road of Sighs and Softness;
these to <i>Lejere</i> are due: But all my Charms, and Arts of gay

Why dost wear a Cloud upon thy brows, when Love’s gay Sunshine dances in
my Eyes? If thou’rt her Lover too, I&nbsp;pity thee; her solemn Vows
breath’d in the height of Love, disarm me <a class="notes" name="brother_texttag44" id="brother_texttag44" href="#brother_textnote44">of thy hopes</a>, if Friendship wou’d permit
thee.</p>

Yes, doubtless, Sir&mdash;she’s prodigal of Vows, and I dare swear, by
all she’s sworn by, she’ll break ’em all: She has less Faith than all
the fickle Sex, uncertain and more wanton than the Winds, that spare no
Births of Nature in their wild course, from the tall Cedar to the
Flowers beneath, but <a class="notes" name="brother_texttag45" id="brother_texttag45" href="#brother_textnote45">ruffle, ravish, and

Away, she that with force of Love can sigh and weep&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Geo.</span>
This very she, has all the while dissembled! Such Love she deals to
every gaudy Coxcomb, how will she practice then upon a Hero?</p>

<p class="notehead">
Dedication</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote1" id="brother_textnote1" href="#brother_texttag1">p. 316, l. 1</a>
<i>The Epistle Dedicatory.</i> This only appears in 4to 1696. It is
there followed by <i>An Account of the Life of the Incomparable Mrs.
BEHN</i>, an entirely worthless composition of some three pages,
afterwards vastly expanded into <i>Memoirs</i> ‘by one of the Fair
Sex’.</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote2" id="brother_textnote2" href="#brother_texttag2">p. 316, l. 21</a>
<i>The narrow Virtues ... [which] were.</i> 4to 1696 omits ‘which’ but
it is necessary that this or some similar word be inserted to make the
paragraph sufficiently grammatical.</p>

<p class="notehead">
Prologue</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote3" id="brother_textnote3" href="#brother_texttag3">p. 319, l. 9</a>
<i>an Intriguer.</i> 4to 1696 ‘the intrigues’.</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote4" id="brother_textnote4" href="#brother_texttag4">p. 319, l. 17</a>
<i>Mistress young.</i> 4to 1696 erroneously gives ‘young’ as a proper
name ‘Mistress Young’.</p>

<p class="notehead">
Dramatis Personæ</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote5" id="brother_textnote5" href="#brother_texttag5">p. 321</a>
<i>Dramatis Personæ.</i> I have added ‘Philip; Diana; Pages, Footmen,
Masqueraders, Servants, Rakehells, &amp;c.’ 4to 1696 spells Britton
‘Brittone’; Mr. Pinketham ‘Mr. Pinkerman.’ Powell is indifferently spelt
‘Powell’ or ‘Powel’.</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote7" id="brother_textnote7" href="#brother_texttag7">p. 327, l. 7</a>
<i>Prince.</i> Here and in ll. 11 and 19 all former editions give
speech-prefix ‘Fred’, but afterwards uniformly ‘Prince’ throughout the
play.</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote8" id="brother_textnote8" href="#brother_texttag8">p. 329, l. 31</a>

<p><a name="brother_textnote9" id="brother_textnote9" href="#brother_texttag9">p. 329, l. 34</a>
<i>Tablets</i>: 4to 1696 gives ‘Tablets write:’ which is obviously a
misprint for ‘Tablets written:’ or, perhaps, ‘Tablets writ’.</p>

<p class="notehead">
Act I: Scene ii</p>

<p><a name="brother_textnote10" id="brother_textnote10" href="#brother_texttag10">p. 330, l. 23</a>

<p><a name="brother_textnote14" id="brother_textnote14" href="#brother_texttag14">p. 337, l. 20</a>
<i>Ay, Sir.</i> 4to 1696 marks this line ‘Aside.’ An obvious error.</p>

<i>Chaplain [Mr. Twang], and leaning.</i> 4to 1696 ‘her Chaplain, and
leaning’. I&nbsp;have inserted Twang’s name and given in <a href="#brother_texttag16a">l.&nbsp;19</a> speech-prefix ‘Twang’ which all
former editions mark ‘Chap.’, altering, however, to ‘Twang’ later in
this scene at ‘Truly, Madam’.</p>

‘(Alone.)’ is probably a misprint for ‘(Aloud.)’ which is of itself
quite unnecessary.</p>

Dedication</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote1" id="brother_commnote1" href="#brother_commtag1">p. 316</a>
<i>Collonel Codrington.</i> Christopher Codrington (1668-1710) was born
at Barbadoes, and thence sent to England to be educated. In 1685 he
passed as a gentleman commoner to Christ Church, Oxford. Five years
later he was elected as a probationer fellow to All Souls. Here he
speedily became known for the catholicity and thoroughness of his
studies, and ‘soon acquir’d the deserv’d character of an accomplished,
well-bred gentleman, and an universal scholar’. He was already an
enthusiastic bibliophile. In 1694 he followed William III to Flanders,
and having fought with great gallantry at Hay and Namur in 1695,
received various military distinctions. In the same year he attended the
King to Oxford, and pronounced the university oration on this royal
visit. There are dedications to him by Creech, Dennis, and others, but
it has been pertinently remarked that ‘his fame is rather to be
inferred’ hence ‘than from actually existent performances on his part’,
albeit we have copies of complimentary verses (e.g. prefixed to Garth’s
<i>Dispensary</i>) from his pen. In 1697 he succeeded his father as
commander-in-chief of the Leeward Isles. He does not seem to have been
popular, and resigned in 1703, retiring to a life of seclusion and study
on his Barbadoes estate. He died 7 April, 1710, and his body was brought
back to England to be buried in All Souls’ chapel. To this college he
left £10,000, and £6,000 worth of books, a&nbsp;legacy which built,
furnished and endowed the magnificent Codrington library there.</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote2" id="brother_commnote2" href="#brother_commtag2">p. 317</a>
<i>Mr. Verbruggen’s reading some of his part.</i> One may remember the
incident recorded by Pepys (2&nbsp;February, 1669), how, after Kynaston
had been assaulted by Sedley’s bravos, and was too ill to appear, the
young actor’s rôle was ‘done by Beeston, who is fain to read it out of a
book all the while and thereby spoils the part, and almost the play, it
being one of the best parts in it.... But it was pleasant to see Beeston
come in with others, supposing it to be dark, and yet he is forced to
read his part by the light of the candles: and this I observing to a
gentleman that sat by me, he was mightily pleased therewith, and spread
it up and down.’</p>

Prologue</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote3" id="brother_commnote3" href="#brother_commtag3">p. 319</a>
<i>grave Sir Roger.</i> ‘Sir Roger’ was a common nickname for any
clergyman from the well-known comic character ‘Sir Roger, Curate to the
<span class="pagenum notes">420</span>
Lady’, in Beaumont and Fletcher’s popular <i>The Scornful Lady</i>. This
excellent play, a&nbsp;rare favourite with Restoration audiences, kept
the boards until the death of Mrs. Oldfield in 1730. After the great
actress’ demise it would seem that none of her successors ventured to
attempt the title-rôle, hence the piece soon fell out of the repertory.
In 1783, however, an alteration, made by Cooke the barrister for Mrs.
Abington, was produced with great success at Covent Garden. In this
meagre adaptation the Curate disappears. Shanks originally acted this
part, but Lacy was the acknowledged ‘Sir Roger’ in Restoration days.</p>

<i>Southampton Square.</i> The original name of Bloomsbury Square, so
called from the Earl of Southampton’s town residence, afterwards Bedford
House. Southampton Square was at this period, and for long afterwards,
the headquarters of fashion in the metropolis: <i>vide</i> further, Vol.
III, <i>The Town Fop</i>, p.&nbsp;22, ‘Southampton House,’ and note on

<i>Mr. Motteux.</i> Peter Anthony Motteux was a French Hugenot who came
to England upon the restoration of the Edict of Nantes (1685). He soon
mixed with the gayest society, and became well known as a prolific
writer of songs, prologues, epilogues, masques, and the lighter dramatic
fare. Much of this work is not lacking in wit and volatile smartness,
but it is all far too ephemeral to have any permanent value as
literature. He edited <i>The Gentleman’s Journal</i>, but is perhaps
best remembered for his translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and his
concluding Urquhart’s version of Rabelais.</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote7" id="brother_commnote7" href="#brother_commtag7">p. 331</a>
<i>the Rose.</i> This celebrated house stood in Russell Street, Covent
Garden, and adjoined Drury Lane. There are innumerable references to it.
The greater portion of the ‘Rose’ was demolished in 1776, when a new
front was being built to the theatre.</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote8" id="brother_commnote8" href="#brother_commtag8">p. 331</a>
<i>scours.</i> i.e. violently assaults. ‘To scour’ was to rampage the
streets, breaking windows, fighting with passers-by, beating the watch,
&amp;c. Shadwell has an excellent comedy, <i>The Scowrers</i> (1691),
which, giving a vivid picture of the times, show these drunken and
blackguardly gentry in a very unamiable light. Several plays treat of
their exploits. Vanbrugh’s <i>The Provoked Wife</i> (1696), Act iii,
<span class="smallroman">II</span>, and iv, <span class="smallroman">II</span> and <span class="smallroman">IV</span>, is
perhaps the locus <ins class="correction" title="text unchanged: usual term is ‘classicus’">classical</ins> for mohocking.</p>

<i>the Poet Sternhold.</i> Thomas Sternhold (<i>ob.</i> 1549), was the
author with John Hopkins (<i>ob.</i> 1570), of a metrical version of the
Psalms, which became a bye-word for doggerel. Sir Morgan is, of course,
alluding to some pious rhymes groaned on the way to the triple tree. cf.
Shadwell, <i>The Miser</i> (1672), i, <span class="smallroman">I</span>, ‘She would be more welcome to thee than a
reprieve would, if thou wert just now trolling out Hopkins and Sternhold
upon a ladder.’</p>

<i>Billmen in Flannel.</i> Bills were the common weapon of the watch.
cf. <i>The Coxcomb</i> (folio 1647), Act i, where Ricardo says to the
constable of the watch, ‘Give me the bill, for I’ll be the sergeant.’
Doctor Johnson tells us that the Lichfield watchmen carried bills as
late as 1778.</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote16" id="brother_commnote16" href="#brother_commtag16">p. 342</a>
<i>a Termer.</i> Originally a frequenter of the law courts, and as many
came up from the country to London during term time on legal business,
it occasionally (as here) signified an unsophisticated stranger. In
Dryden’s <i>Sir Martin Mar-All</i> (1667), i, Mrs. Millicent, newly
arrived from Canterbury, replies to Lady Dupe’s greeting, ‘I came up,
Madam, as we country-gentlewomen use at an Easter term, to the
destruction of tarts and cheese cakes, to see a new play, buy a new
gown, take a turn in the Park, and so down again to sleep with my
forefathers.’ In Mountford’s farce, <i>Dr. Faustus</i> (4to 1697, but
produced at the Theatre Royal November-December, 1685, or very early in
1686), we have Scaramouch asking what practice the Doctor has, and
Harlequin replies: ‘Why his Business is to patch up rotten Whores
against the Term for Country Lawyers and Attorneys Clerks; and against
<i>Christmas</i>, <i>Easter</i>, and <i>Whitsun</i> Holidays, for City
Apprentices.’ cf. Southerne’s <i>Oroonoko</i> (1696), i, <span class="smallroman">I</span>, when Charlot Welldon says to her sister Lucia,
‘Nay, the young Inns-of-Court beaus, of but one Term’s standing in the
fashion, who knew nobody but as they were shown ’em by the orange-women,
had nicknames for us.’ More often a Termer meant ‘A person, whether male
or female, who resorted to London in term time only, for the sake of
tricks to be practised, or intrigues to be carried on at that period.’

<i>Sa.</i> i.e. Save us! Sir Morgan has a frequent exclamation ‘God sa

Act III: Scene i</p>

<p><a name="brother_commnote18" id="brother_commnote18" href="#brother_commtag18">p. 356</a>
<i>the Country of True Love.</i> Mrs. Behn, an omnivorous reader of
romances, was thinking of the celebrated <i>Carte de Tendre</i>
(Loveland), to be found in Mlle. de Scudéri’s <i>Clélie</i> (1654, Vol.
I, p.&nbsp;399), and reproduced in the English folio edition of 1678.
This fantastic map, which is said to have been suggested by Chapelain,
aroused unbounded ridicule. In scene <span class="smallroman">IV</span> of Molière’s <i>Les Précieuses Ridicules</i>
(1659), Cathos cries, ‘Je m’en vais gager qu’ils n’ont jamais vu la
carte de Tendre, et que Billets-Doux, Petits-Soins, Billets-Galante, et
Jolis-Vers sont des terres inconnues pour eux.’ This imaginary land is
divided by the River of Inclination: on the one side are the towns of
Respect, Generosity, A&nbsp;Great Heart, and the like; on the other
Constant Friendship, Assiduity, Submission, &amp;c. Across the Dangerous
Sea another continent is marked, ‘Countreys undiscovered.’ <i>Terra
Incognita.</i></p>

<p>The extravagant penchant for romances of the Scudéri
<i>Parthenissa</i> school was amply satirized by Steele in his clever
comedy <i>The Tender Husband</i> (1705), and as late as 1752 by Mrs.
Charlotte Lennox in <i>The Female Quixote</i>, an amusing novel.</p>

<i>old Queen Bess in the Westminster-Cupboard.</i> The waxen effigies
which yet remain at Westminster are preserved in the wainscot presses
over the Islip Chapel. Queen Elizabeth, in her tattered velvet robes, is
still one of the most famous. They were formerly far more numerous.
A&nbsp;waxen figure of the deceased, dressed in the habit worn whilst
living, was, in the case of any royal or notable personage, very
frequently carried as part of the torchlight funeral procession and,
after the obsequies, left over the grave to serve as a kind of temporary
monument.</p>

celebrated Madame de Fontanges. Her hair coming down during a
hunting-party at Vincennes, she tied it up hastily with one of her
garters. Louis XIV, whose mistress she was, so admired the result that
he begged her to continue to wear her hair in the same way. This set the
fashion, which soon spread into England and long remained popular. cf.
Shadwell’s <i>Bury Fair</i> (1689), ii, <span class="smallroman">II</span>: ‘<i>Milliner.</i> What d’ye lack, Ladies? fine

<p><i>Lucky Chance</i> note:</p>

<p class="inset">
<i>write for a Third day only</i>. The whole profits of the third day’s
performance went to the author of the play; and upon these
occasions his friends and patrons would naturally rally to support him.
There are numberless allusions to this custom, especially in Prefaces,
Prologues and Epilogues.</p>

<p><i>Rover II</i> text:</p>

For your parts, who are the poor dependent, brown Bread and old Adam’s
Ale is only current amongst ye</p>

<p><i>Rover II</i> note:</p>

<p class="inset">
<i>old Adam’s Ale.</i> A very ancient colloquialism for water. In
Scotland ‘Adam’s wine’ and frequently merely ‘Adam’. Prynne in his
<i>Sovereign Power of Parliament</i> (1648), speaks of prisoners
‘allowed only a poor pittance of Adam’s ale.’ cf. Peter Pindar (John
Wolcot), <i>The Lousiad</i>, Canto ii, ll. 453-4:&mdash; </p>

<p>Old Adam’s beverage flows with pride</p>
<p>From wide-mouthed pitchers in a plenteous tide.</p>

<i>this Tour.</i></p>

<p><i>False Count</i> text:</p>

<p class="inset">
you must be a Lady, and have your Petticoats lac’d four Stories high;
wear your false Towers, and cool your self with your <i>Spanish</i>
Fan</p>

<p><i>False Count</i> note:</p>

<p class="inset">
<i>Towers.</i> The tower at this time was a curled frontlet of false
hair. cf. Crowne’s <i>The Country Wit</i> (1675), Act ii,&nbsp;<span
class="smallroman">II</span>, where Lady Faddle cries to her maid,
‘run to my milliner’s for my gloves and essences ... run for my new
towre.’ Shadwell, <i>The Virtuoso</i> (1676), Act iii, mentions ‘Tires
for the head, locks, tours, frouzes, and so forth’. <i>The Debauchee</i>
(1677), Act ii,&nbsp;<span class="smallroman">I</span>: Mrs. Saleware
speaks of buying ‘fine clothes, and tours, and Points and knots.’ <i>The
Younger Brother</i> (1696), Act v, the last scene, old Lady Youthly
anxiously asks her maid, ‘is not this Tour too brown?’ During the reign
of Mary II and particularly in the time of Anne a Tower meant almost
exclusively the high starched head-dress in vogue at that period.</p>

Arrangement of Editor’s Notes</a></h4>

<p>In the printed book, all notes were grouped at the end of the volume
as “Notes on the Plays” and “Notes: Critical and Explanatory”. For this
e-text, Notes have been placed after their respective plays.</p>

<p>The Notes as printed give only page and line numbers. References to
Acts and Scenes were added by the transcriber. All links lead directly
to the cited text. Annotated passages are identified in the body text
with two kinds of link: <a class="notes" href="#notes">dotted
underlining</a> for text notes; <a class="comm" href="#notes">solid
underlining</a> for critical notes. Passages that have both kinds of
note are linked to the “Critical and Explanatory” note.</p>

<p>The critical notes include a few cross-references to other volumes of
the Complete Works. Where appropriate, these texts are quoted after each
play’s Notes. The “N.E.D.” of the Notes is now generally known as the
OED.</p>

<p>In the Notes, the variation between .’ and ’. (close quote before or
after final period) is as printed and has not been regularized. The
abbreviation “cf.” is always lower-case. Brackets are in the
original.</p>
